  - in the original, the page crash at start (due to "modules" problem).
    - replaced "modules" by normal js files 
      - removed "export " in the scripts/modules/*.mjs files
      - renamed scripts/modules/cards.mjs to scripts/cards.js
      - renamed scripts/modules/scoring.mjs to scripts/scoring.js
      - in scripts/scripts.js :
        - removed the first lines ("use strict" and the 2 import)
        - removed " cards." BUT AVOID the first 2 two matchs (it's only for the console message)
        - removed "scoring."
    - in index.html
      - replaced "<script type=module" by type="text/javascript"
      - renamed the previous ".mjs" to the new path/
      - moved "scripts" at end on the page
    - tested index.html : working.
  - deleted the sound (the shuffle at each "Deal") and the background image.
    - Note : background image is 7.25 MB (!!), and shuffle.wav is 1 MB.
    - clean the files in index.html, scripts/scripts.js and css/style.css (see setting, checkbox, background...)
  - trying some layout changes on css/style.css and index.html
