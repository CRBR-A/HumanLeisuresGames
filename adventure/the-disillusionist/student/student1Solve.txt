Ms. Denotto seems very pleased with the results you deliver. She's practically licking her
lips with excitement at her prospects. "With this much, I could probably even _place_ at
the symposium. I should have hired you years ago!"

She's all too happy to part with her old research materials. You are shocked to discover that
Mr. Brown provided her with a live demon in a cage. The things are exceedingly rare, and just
seeing the little fiend's golden compound eyes takes your mind back to times better left
forgotten.

Ms. Denotto misinterprets your reverie as concern. "Don't worry, this is
totally legal. Here—" She hands you a sheaf of papers. "These papers prove that he's
legitimate, culled from the old battlefields and not some demonologist's weekend mistake."

The other materials are nothing so interesting. Indeed, you'll probably just hock them later.
But as she reaches to hand over the last packet, Amber stops. "Can I— Can I keep just one
thing? To remember him by. Mr. Brown was actually quite good as a mentor."

She opens the packet to reveal two tiny objects. "Go ahead, take either one you like. Just
leave the other one for me."
