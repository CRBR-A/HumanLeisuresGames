title: A nervous-looking student

If they ever throw a rocking chair convention for cats and provide free coffee, it might begin
to equal this young lady's level of nerves. You make sure to approach from the front, where
she can see you.

"What do you want?" she hisses as you slide into the chair opposite.

You explain yourself.

"Oh— Oh really? Hey, you might be able to help me! My name's Amber Denotto." She shakes your
hand. "I'm one of Mr. Brown's students. Or _was_, if the rumors are to be believed. It's
enough for the university, anyway. They want to reassign me to a new mentor, and that means
giving up the research materials Mr. Brown provided to me."

"I'd be willing to part with them to you instead, though. Just… a little tit-for-tat, you
know? I need your help with something first."

You pointedly continue listening silently.

"The seasonal symposium is coming up soon. If I get reassigned and have to start my project
over, there's no way I stand a chance of placing for a prize, which means no chance of keeping
my scholarship. Unless… Unless I had some way
of knowing what competition I'm up against. If I could tailor my new project to the judges
and make sure it stands out from the competition, I should at least be able to get an
honorable mention."

"Do that, and my old project materials from Mr. Brown are yours."
