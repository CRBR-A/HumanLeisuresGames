title: It was late on a Tuesday…
'''
It was late on a Tuesday when Mrs. Abigail Brown walked into your office. Normally, when a
lady that well-dressed sees fit to cross your door, there's infidelity behind it. It means
long nights staking out a love nest in your future, waiting for Mr. Client to come dally with
Not-Mrs. Client.

But something was off. This wasn't the usual cheating-husband job. There was a tear to her
eye before she even
got in your door, not the mixture of determination and shame that eventually gave way to
either sobbing or rage.

Over the next forty-five minutes, you drew the whole story out of her. How she was the wife
of famed sorcerer Horace Brown. How he had gone missing two weeks ago from a sealed parlor
in their Silver Street home. How the police had dismissed the case with suspicious ease,
insisting Mr.
Brown must have simply had an accident with forces beyond his control. As if "Demon Eyes
Brown" had ever met a force he could not match.

You took the case in a heartbeat. This was not only the most interesting case to cross your
desk since there was snow on the ground, but it stood to be the most lucrative in a long time,
and the landlord was starting to resemble a hungry wolf more and more each day. Mrs. Brown
paid the retainer for your first two days and didn't even haggle the rate.

Now the only question was: Where to start looking?
