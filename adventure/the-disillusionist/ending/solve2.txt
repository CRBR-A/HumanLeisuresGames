title: A sharp knock

You are promptly admitted. Your companions draw a few raised eyebrows, but you insist that
they are vital to your
investigation. You also insist on meeting Mrs. Brown at the scene of the crime. It's dramatic,
perhaps, but not half as dramatic as what you're here to do.

Once you've been left alone with Mrs. Brown, you regard her for a long moment. The illusion is
almost perfection. Whoever created her knew Mrs. Brown better than anyone in this world. And
the wards in place to dissuade magical detection are advanced sorcery of the highest caliber.
This is the work of a master, no doubt about it, and a master with intimate knowledge of
Mrs. Brown. To anyone not in posession of your particular talents and knowledge, it would be
impossible to tell.

"Why— Why are you staring at me?" she stammers.

You don't answer. Instead, you inform her that you have found Mr. Brown.
You explain that her husband is, in fact, not dead. This
news heartens her, to your dismay.

"Where is he, then?!?" she gasps. "Has he been kidnapped? Is he— is he hiding?"
