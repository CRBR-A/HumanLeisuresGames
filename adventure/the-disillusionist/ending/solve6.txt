title: A fate resolved

"Why?!? Because he took something beautiful and wonderful away! Because she
deserved to be in this world and he didn't anymore! So I made him disappear and tried to bring
her back. I made him into her, body and mind. Butâ€”" There's a frustrated growl.
"It wasn't enough. It wasn't the same. I couldn't forget who was
underneath her skin. It was torture to be around him. But I couldn't bring myself to undo the
illusion; it would be like killing her all over again myself.
So I erased myself from her memory and
tried to scare her out of town. Out of sight, and someday out of mind.

"Surely you understand, Dis.
Just as I'm sure you know you can't just take him to the police now. He's got them in his
pocket. And a master sorcerer like him? Even if they convicted him, they'd never
hold him."

She steps where you can see her and levels her gun at Mr. Brown. "The only way to ensure that
Abigail gets justice is to end him myself."
