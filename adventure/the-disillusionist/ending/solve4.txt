title: A man revealed

The boxer is on him in a moment. He's up against the wall before he has time to recover his
senses. The wizard continues to keep the warpweave out, in hopes of denying him access to
magic. You breathe a sigh of relief. Exposing Mr. Horace Brown was easy enough, but locking
him down before he could escape was a risk.

It wasn't Mr. Brown that disappeared that night. It was Mrs. Abigail Brown. You never actually
met her because she was already dead before you got involved.

She'd been cheating on Mr.
Brown. With evidence of her infidelity in hand, Horace had confronted her. There'd been a
fight. A fight that got physical. A fight that got magical.
And at a clear disadvantage in that situation, Abigail Brown had died, and her body had ended
up in the river. Mr. Brown used his connections to shush the police from investigating.
And that might have been the end of
it, if not for the intervention of a third party.

A third party that thinks you don't know she's creeping in the window behind you.
