title: A fate resolved

The gunshot rings across the parlor, drowning out all other noise.

"Curse you, Dis!" Roxy screams as she knocks you away and takes aim for a second attempt.

But there's no one to aim at. Behind you, you hear a thump, and you feel the magical
pressure return to the room. Turning
around, you see your wizard knocked out. For a moment, you see Mr. Brown standing over him,
but then there is only a twinkling of blue light.

"I'll get you, Horace Brown! You can't run from me!" And moments later, Roxy is gone in a
similar twinkling.

The police aggressively ignore your attempts to explain the whole incident. With Mr. Brown
potentially alive, they're still under the gun to keep this secret. You and your
companions are released after a day of cursory interviewing with an unsubtle warning to keep
your mouths shut.

If ther's a silver lining to all this, it's that this is the last you hear of Horace Brown
_or_ Roxy. Whether she abandoned her post to chase her lover's murderer or she was beaten by
her quarry, you don't know. But Roxy never returns to lead her gang, and eventually they
succumb to internal
strife between those warring for her position. The police get significant portions of her
gang, and others still are killed in the conflict.

All told, the city is a little safer.
For now.
