title: A woman revealed

You hear the click of a revolver cocking from behind you.

"Dis. I can't believe you were really fool enough to undo it. To bring that monster back into
this world. What the hell do you think you're doing?!?"

Ah, Roxy. Roxy the gangster. Roxy the sorceress. As you suspected, she was Mrs. Brown's
lover. She found Mr. Brown with the body and transformed him into the simulacrum that has been
living as Mrs. Brown for the last few weeks. The one that hired you to look for the missing
husband that was right under her nose the whole time.
