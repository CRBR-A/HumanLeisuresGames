title: A fate resolved
'''
The gunshot rings across the parlor, drowning out all other noise. Blood begins to spread
across Mr. Brown's body, soaking into the wall behind him. Your boxer stumbles backwards in
surprise, dropping the now-dead Mr. Brown. He flops to the ground like a puppet without
strings.

There's a thump behind you, and you feel the magical pressure return to the room. Turning
around, you see your wizard knocked out. There's footsteps rushing towars the door, but Roxy
is already gone. There's just a twinkling of blue light where she once stood.

The next week is hell for you and your companions. With Mr. Brown dead, the police no longer
have an incentive to overlook this case and launch a full investigation. Eventually,
though, they have to let you go. Your gun wasn't fired that night, and it doesn't match the
bullet's caliber anyway. Your partners weren't
packing. Besides, the idea that a notorious gangland master did the killing isn't a hard sell.

They dismiss your wild stories about illusory women and broken hearts, though.
Instead, they pin Roxy
with the blame for Mrs. Brown's death as well. If the police ever catch up with her, it'll be
a very bitter day.
