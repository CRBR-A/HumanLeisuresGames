title: Thanks for reading

Thank you for playing **The Disillusionist**, my entry in the 2015 EXPER3 challenge. I hope
you enjoyed the experience. Perhaps, if you did not get the ending you wanted or if there are
leads you haven't followed up on, you may want to hit that reset button in the corner and try
again.

Writing this game has been eye-opening for me and a great challenge. I won't pretend it isn't
without its flaws, but I'm proud of it considering it's my first fiction writing in over a
decade. If you didn't enjoy the experience, then I apologize, and you can get a full refund of
your $0. In fact, I've already sent it to you.

Thank you for coming on this journey with me.
