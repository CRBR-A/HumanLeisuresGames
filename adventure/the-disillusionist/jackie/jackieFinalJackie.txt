title: Honesty is always the best policy
'''
You leave her screaming obscenities after you as you leave. If she's smart, she'll be packing
up and covering her trail again before Jackie arrives.

You drive straight to Jackie's and spill the beans. He almost runs out before he has time to
pay up. You drag him back to reality and he hurriedly dumps a huge file on your lap before
ushering you out and racing towards the suburb where a very awkward shouting match awaits.

The file explains that Mr. Brown's concerns were as old as time, the bread and butter of the
sleuthing trade: He thought his wife was cheating on him. Jackie had been gathering photos and
info for two weeks before Mr. Brown disappeared and the whole file became worthless. And
judging by the contents, Mr. Brown was right to be worried. Mrs. Brown apparently has some
very specific interests that were going very unfulfilled by Mr. Brown. Could she be more
involved than she's letting on? Or, alternatively, could one of the other people pictured be
behind this?
