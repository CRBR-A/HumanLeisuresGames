title: Jackie, old-school detective
'''
Jackie is in his office when you find him. It's never a good sign if Jackie is in his
office. It means he's too out of work to be busy and too despondent to be drinking. Judging
by his state, times are even tougher than you thought.

"Oh god, it's you," he mutters as you enter. "And to what do I owe the pleasure of the great
Disillusionist's presence?"

You explain about Horace Brown.

"What? Is that all? You know what I'm going to say. Same thing you would if I came to you,
Dis. 'Screw off!' What kind of detective would I be if I didn't respect my clients'
confidentiality? People come here for all sorts of private stuff. I'd be out of work in no
time if I started spilling their beans."

You suppress the urge to argue that, point of fact, it doesn't look like anyone has been
coming here for _any_ sort of stuff lately. Instead, you appeal to the point that Mr. Brown
is missing, possibly dead, and this could help lead to his rescue.

"That just makes it worse. If he's dead, he can't tell anyone whether he'd give a damn about
my secrecy, can he? Get lost, pal. These lips are sealed."
