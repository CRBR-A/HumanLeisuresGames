title: Try to bribe him
'''
For a long moment, Jackie hungrily eyes the bills in your hand. But just when you think he's
going to take your offerâ€”

"Put that away." He slumps in his chair. "This is really that important to you, huh?"

He eyes the empty desk on the opposite side of the room. "She's gone. Did you even notice?"
Come to think of it, where _is_ his partner? "Just up and stormed out a few weeks ago. Said
she had to seek 'greener pastures,' whatever that means.

"I'm nothing without her, Dis. I may be the sandpaper skin and muscle of this team, but she
was the brains. This outfit was on hard times before, but it's falling apart without her.

"I've tried to find her, but she's fallen off the map so well, I can't even get a whiff of
her. But then, she knows all my techniques; she's better-qualified than anyone to avoid me.
But you! You, she isn't so well-equipped to avoid. Find her for me, and I'll forget about
detective-client confidentiality for a bit as regards the quite-likely-late Mr. Brown and his
concerns."
