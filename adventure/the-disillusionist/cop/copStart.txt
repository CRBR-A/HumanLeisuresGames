title: A crooked cop
'''
Dentley thumbs the stack of bills to make sure you aren't shorting him. "Horace Brown, eh?
Funny you should mention him. That name just came across my desk this morning."

You ask whether this means the police are going to investigate the disappearance after all.

"No, no, nothing like that. His _alleged_ disappearanceâ€¦" Something gives even Dentley pause.
"That investigation is being shut down from a very high level. No, he came up as a person of
interest in another case. Of course, as no one can find him, that's a request I am putting
no effort into fulfilling."

"There was a body. Washed up on the south banks near the granary district. It also vanished
before we could bring it in. I don't know any more than that, but someone thinks it's tied to
Brown, somehow, so it's probably of interest to you."
