title: Not much left
'''
You burst into the warehouse and order everyone on the floor. Like terrified lambs, they all
comply. Despite their sick tendencies, these men and women aren't savage or prepared to
defend themselves. They're lucky you found them and their crime first; the police might
have come in with guns blazing.

They're "ghouls," or at least that's how they fancy themselves. People who think this era of
casual magic gives them the right to appropriate old cultural traditions and use them as a
cover for their twisted desires.

You gather what's left of the body in a sack and warn them to get lost before the police
arrive. You make haste to the precinct before the body starts to smell, but not before taking
a peek for yourself.

There's not much left, but what's there is confusing. The body is female, unqestionably.
There are bits of clothing from a dress similar to the one
Mrs. Brown was wearing the day she walked into your office. Also a broach that's identical
to one you've seen at the Brown household. And judging by the time of its discovery and its
state at the time, this person probably died within a day before or after Mr. Brown
disappearing. There's no hope of identifying this person now, but
this is definitely tied to your case somehow.
