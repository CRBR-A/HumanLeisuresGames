title: Begin searching for her
'''
There's a through-line to the stories on the street about Roxy's gang. For the last six
months, they've been having
trouble bringing enough people to bear to pressure the other gangs. And they're more focused
on consolidating power in the magic districts. It all adds up to one thing: Roxy must have
moved her base of operations east, away from downtownâ€¦ and right into the vicinity of
the Brown mansion.

Based on shakedown rates in various districts, you figure Roxy's hideout must be somewhere
within an area of about fifteen blocks on the east end. It's still a wide area, but it's a
start.
