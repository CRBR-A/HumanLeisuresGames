title: Mysterious letters
'''
Once safely back in your office, you peruse the letters with great curiosity. They appear to
be love letters. You have no idea who this Joy person is, nor who she was writing to, but
the smell of perfume on them is tugging at your memory, as if you've smelled it before. And
whoever she is, she uses the post office near Mr. Brown's mansion.
