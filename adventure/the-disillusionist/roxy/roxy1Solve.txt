title: In a disused print shop
'''
The print shop's shell only takes up a small portion of the first floor, but it's been
magicked to appear larger than it is, to cover up the fact that the rest of the building is
filled with gangsters.

Roxy won't deign to see you if you just walk up to the front door. Not after what happened
last time. So it looks like breaking and entering is your only option. You slip in a back door
and slide through a hallucinatory wall. You're upstairs and rifling through files without
anyone being the wiser. Their contents aren't very revealing, though. Nothing in here really
explains the link to Mr. Brown.

You've just spotted a locked cabinet in the corner and are considering how to best open it
when a lowly runner wanders in and spots you. He rushes out and sounds the alarm. Cursing your
luck, you shoot the lock off. Inside is a stack of envelopes and a small, magical charm.

You're going to need a hand free to hold your gun. Which do you take?

    You've seen these before. They're used to overcome illusions.
