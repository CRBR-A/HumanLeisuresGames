title: Roxy Malone, big-time gangster
'''
There are three big gangs in the city. North of the river belongs to Mac Turleigh's boys.
The financial district is under the watchful eye of Ambrose Beard. And everything else?
Everything else belongs to Roxy Malone's gang.

Roxy appeared during the war, already leading a small gang of street toughs. While the old
gangs had their eyes turned to war profiteering, she was qietly eating away at their
territory back home. While the old gangs were trying to understand how to get mages to work
for them, she was already an accomplished sorceress in her own right. Roxy was a native of
the new world. And one by one, the old gangs fell before her or joined her outright. Smart
money says she won't rest until she owns the whole city.

So why is she concerning herself with Mrs. Brown? What does she have to gain from driving a
grieving woman from her home? There's more going on here than meets the eye.

This won't be the first time you two have crossed paths, but you don't know where she's
operating out of these days. You'll need to get a bead on Roxy before you can confront her.
