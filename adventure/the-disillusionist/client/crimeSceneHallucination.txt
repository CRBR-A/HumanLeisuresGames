title: Evidence of hallucinations
'''
If there were any hallucinations here, they've been cleaned up. But sometimes a hallucination
is telling by its absence. There are three suspicious gaps in the decor on the wall opposite
the windows. By the looks of it, there were hallucinations here for quite some time; the
staff had been cleaning around them. Were they Brown's work? Or somehow related to his
disappearance?
