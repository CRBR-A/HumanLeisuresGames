title: Ask what's wrong
'''
"Oh, it's horrible! You just missed them! Two thugs were here, making threats! Warning
me to stop the investigation! Telling me to leave town!"

After you calm Mrs. Brown down, you get a description of the thugs. The purple carnation
lapel pins make them
easy to identify. These boys belonged to Roxy Malone, one of the three biggest gangsters in
the city. What Roxy's stake in this is, you have no idea, but you aim to ask her.

You make a point of not asking if Mrs. Brown wants the investigation called off, and she
doesn't make a point of telling you. This one is too juicy to let slip away.
