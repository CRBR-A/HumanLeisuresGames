title: A dealer in rarities
'''
You can't even open your mouth before the rarities dealer recognizes you for what you are.
"How the hell did you even get in here, you burnout!? Where's security?"

Before he can summon anyone, you slam the demon cage down on the table. It shuts him right
up. At his quizzical stare, you produce the demon's papers. He looks them over, then looks
them over again, unable to believe that someone as mundane as yourself could get your
hands on such an esoteric item.

Finally, he grunts his assent. "I'll concede, you are something special. I don't have any use
for it, but I'll put it up for sale. If anyone wants the little bastard, you get 50% after
taxes.
And if you're interested in making any other trades, why not come by my shop later yourself?"
He produces a card with an address and a password.
