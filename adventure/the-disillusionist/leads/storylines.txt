title: Track down a lead
'''
You sit down at your desk and pool all your possible leads. Someone out there has to
know something about what happened. The question is: Who?

_If you successfully start a lead, you will be committed to that lead and unable to follow up
any others until you see your current lead through._

  choice 'clubEntry',
    'The Salamander Club'
    '''
    Ever since you lost your magical abilities, you've lost touch with the magical community
    in the city.
    The Salamander Club is a favorite watering hole of the sorcerous set and your best bet to
    make contact with anyone who might know Mr. Brown.
