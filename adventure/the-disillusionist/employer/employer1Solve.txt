title: A most eclectic crew
'''
Against all odds, a group like the one Kimble, Battherwhite, and Smith wants actually exists.
Though they primarily make their living as musicians now, they all have magical backgrounds
that match KB&S's needs. And, more importantly, they are keen to make some money putting those
talents to work. "Beats singing another night for tips at The Red Squirrel."

The man in the sharp suit is pleased. As the troupe is ushered away to Contractor Orientation,
he turns back to you. "And don't think I've forgotten your payment. Let me tell you exactly
what they'll be doing."

You learn less of use than you'd hoped, and several things you wish perhaps you had never
known. About ancient religions given new
relevance in this magical age. About a grand ceremony in the planning. Mr. Brown was not
actually working for KB&S, _per se_. Rather, he had been employed by Battherwhite, Esq.
herself to prepare an elaborate ritual basement. You're quite sure she's completely mad, but
as the sharp-suited man reminds you as he steers you towards the exit, "As you can see, Mr.
Brown's disappearance puts us at rather a disadvantage, so we couldn't possibly have been
involved. It's been a great burden on us, until you came along."

As consolation, he presses a small gemstone on you. "We have dozens, and I think
someone in your line of work will find it eminently useful."
