talk: 
  "I'm telling you," she says, "something weird is going on. That kid down
  the street swears a vampire got his mom. Then there's my boss; she said it got
  her husband. And there's a run on garlic at the Fresh-Mart."
  "Rumors," he laughs, "the kid's probably messing with you, your boss is a drunk
  and garlic makes great Italian food."
  "Yeah, but our neighbor?" she insists, "he says there's a ghost in the cemetery
  warning people!"
  "Honey, the guy's crazy!" he laughs, "I mean come on, he took apart his camping
  tent so he could get a wooden stake. Oh, steak, should have gotten that."
grab: You grab a taco. Yum!
