location: CEMETERY
time: night
look: 
    The full moon shines on the tombstones, making the place even spookier than
    usual. A man with an old-fashioned lantern stands watch.
exits: NORTH, SOUTH, WEST
go:
  north: ST. MARY'S CATHEDRAL
  south: 16-MILE CREEK
  east: Can't go that way.
  west: LIBRARY
talk:
  "In darkest hour of evil's night, Your only hope is in the light.
  If your life you wish to save, place the Book inside her grave..."
  The man disappears! Was that a ghost? What was that?! What book? What was
  that about light? You look around, and don't see a grave that looks like it
  could be hers. All the women's graves had names like Amy Smith and Jane Brown.
  The vampire's grave isn't here.
grab: Nothing to grab here.
