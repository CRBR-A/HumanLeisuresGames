location: LOWLAND FIRE HALL
time: day
look: 
  The garage doors are open, and people are putting up decorations like paper
  bats, rubber spiders, and glowing orange lights. Two guys lug a cauldron as
  big as a bathtub, and a lady hangs long black ribbons over a door.

  north: HIKING TRAIL
  south: W PUTNAM ST.

talk: 
  "Don't tell anyone I said this," says a fireman, "but we've been super busy
  looking for missing people. We got a call from a lady whose husband was
  attacked. I don't know who or what it is, but it's weird. We're Fire & Rescue,
  not the dang Ghostbusters! And now when I finally get a break they got us
  setting up for a party. Sheesh!"
grab: You grab a cup of cider. Mmmm!
