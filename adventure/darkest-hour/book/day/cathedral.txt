talk: 
  "Bless you!" says the priest, crossing himself. "You're looking for a vampire?
  I can't say anything officially, but I've heard... the stories are true. A
  young man who used to attend mass here went missing... I've already said more
  than I should. But I will say this: I've often heard vampires hate holy
  things. As a boy I played a video game where you used holy water as a weapon
  (not that I'd recommend that), but if you can find a crucifix, it might help."

  !ITEM_CRUCIFIX: You grab the crucifix.
