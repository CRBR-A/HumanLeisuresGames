location: MATTHEWS MANSION
time: day
look:
  You walk down another row of houses and come to another corner. Here, one big
  house takes up half the street. It's old and a bit spooky, but not abandoned
  or anything. It's actually a very nice place, with a fancy iron gate and a
  little tower like a castle. If this is where the vampire lives, she must be
  swimming in money!
