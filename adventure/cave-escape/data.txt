ROOM:         DESCRIPTIONS:
hole|         You awake to see yourself looking at the light from a HOLE in the ceiling. You look around. It seems you've fallen into a cave. There is a Bandage on the ground, which may be useful. There are two paths, to your LEFT you hear the soft sound of running water. To your right, you hear the squeaks of what seem to be a RAT. Which way do you go? Type "help" for help.|    You remember this room like you remember the bruise on the back of your head. To your LEFT you hear the soft sound of running water. To your right, is the room with the RAT.
left|         Somehow, your legs are functional and manage to carry you from room to room. This is fortunate, because a Torch on the wall reveals another fork in the path, with more rooms. You may continue to follow the sound of water to the WATERFALL, walk into the dark, scary TUNNEL, head back to the HOLE you fell into, or perhaps stay and Examine the place!| This place is small and claustrophobic, you think to yourself. You can go to the WATERFALL, the dark TUNNEL, or the HOLE where you began.| Looking closer at your surroundings you see a Body next to the water. You may want to examine the Body, or maybe get a Drink of the odd looking water. You are thirsty after all. Also, picking up that Torch may be a good idea. You can go to WATERFALL, the TUNNEL, or the HOLE.
rat|          You walk towards the sound of a rat. You're shocked. It's a rat.| With the rat dead, you see another Bandage on the ground. You can goto HOLE, where you started.
tunnel|       It's too dark. You let your eyes adjust. It's still too dark. You hear the snarl of an angry canine. You can't go on further, unless you use a Torch. Where had you seen one before?|  Your torch illuminates a fearsome wolf gnawing on fresh meat.| With the wolf dead, you may head back LEFT or continue onto the EXTENSION.
extension|    The end of the road. Your torch illuminates a Corpse lying against a wall, and a unused Beartrap sits patiently next to you. There's no where else to go but back into the TUNNEL.| End of the road, the corpse is still here but maybe you should head back to TUNNEL.
secret|       Clicks and clacks of mechanisms hidden within the walls begin, and the door slowly opens up revealing a dimly lit, but otherwise well decorated room. You try the doors, and they're all locked except for two. A room with a CAGE startles you as a wolf attempts to jump at you in rage. You figure it may be best to not mess with it, however you notice an unused speargun lying within the cage. The only other available room is one labeled LAB. If you'd like, you can head back to the WATERFALL. | This lobby-esqe room is irksome. You wonder what happened here. You can head into the LAB, "greet" the wolf in the CAGE, or head back into the WATERFALL.
cage|         A fearsome wolf is ready to unleash its rage!| With the wolf dead, it looks like you can pick up that Speargun and head back to the SECRET room.
waterfall|    You follow the sounds to a waterfall. The water looks odd, and illuminates the cave. What's that at the base of it? You walk through the water to reveal a securely locked door with a keypad! It has four digit slots, waiting for input. What could possibly be on the other side? | The waterfall is pretty, but its slight glow is off-putting. You step up to the keypad.
lab|          You slide the lab door open, revealing a large, starving bear helping itself to a poor sucker in a lab coat. Uh oh, this is not going to end well!| With the bear defeated you notice a priceless aztec STATUE sitting firmly upon an altar at the rear of the room. You can goto the STATUE, or it might be a good idea to just use that cellphone and get the hell out of here.
statue|      You approach the priceless Aztec statue. It is the most glorious object you have ever laid eyes on. It's worth could bring you countless fortune and would make this hell-ish adventure worth it's literal weight in gold.

ROOM:         EXAMINATION:
hole|         You look up towards the light. It seems too simple a mistake to cost you your life, but fate thinks otherwise. If you played basketball through college, you feel you could simply leap up into the hole and leave. You'd rather die than play college ball, though. Turns out that may just be the truth. There is a free Bandage on the ground. You may head to the LEFT, or greet the RAT.
left|         The TORCH on the wall flickers. The cave is rather small, with the craggy rock walls arching upwards. The dark TUNNEL holds a looming fear over you. The sound of the WATERFALL keeps your peace, however. You may also head back to the HOLE.
rat|          Poor guy, must have fallen in just as easily as you did. It is survival of the fittest, and you yearn the rewards (a knife, in this case). You may head back to the HOLE.
tunnel|       The walls begin to narrow, signalling the end of the tunnel is near. Your shivering fear of the wolf remains after you vanquished it. This tunnel is only a continuation from the LEFT, and leads onwards into the EXTENSION.
extension|    The stench of the corpse is a bit difficult to bare. What else is difficult to bare? The Beartrap sitting there, unused. You figure it'd be perfect for use on enemies. You can only head back into the TUNNEL.
secret|       The walls are made of metal, and this place seemingly looks like a lobby of some sort. Furniture is knocked over, papers everywhere, the room is a mess, but you can tell this once held a safe work environment for...someone. You hear deep grunts of a familiar creature coming from the lab. You may head to the wolf CAGE, the LAB, or back to the WATERFALL.
cage|         The metal bars of the cage are chipped. You figure the wolf was rather hungry. Or perhaps wanted to escape. You may head back to the SECRET room.
lab|          There is broken glass everywhere, and the only way to see the room is a pulsing red light. No matter, you have a cellphone with shoddy, but usable service. There is also a STATUE in the next room.
