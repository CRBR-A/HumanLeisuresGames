  The end of the road. Your torch illuminates a Corpse lying against a wall, 
  He is smelly and looks as if it has been mauled. He clutches a paper in 
  his hand. A unused Beartrap sits patiently next to him. There's no where else to 
  go but back into the TUNNEL.
  End of the road, the corpse is still here but maybe you should head back to
  TUNNEL.
