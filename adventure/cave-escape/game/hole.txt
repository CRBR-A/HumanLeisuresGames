  You awake to see yourself looking at the light from a HOLE in the ceiling. 
  You look around. It seems you've fallen into a cave. There is a Bandage on 
  the ground, which may be useful. There are two paths, to your LEFT you hear
  the soft sound of running water. To your right, you hear the squeaks of 
  what seem to be a RAT. 
  
  You remember this room like you remember the bruise on the back of your 
  head. To your LEFT you hear the soft sound of running water. To your right,
  is the room with the RAT.
  
  You look up towards the light. It seems too simple a mistake to cost you 
  your life, but fate thinks otherwise. If you played basketball through 
  college, you feel you could simply leap up into the hole and leave. You'd 
  rather die than play college ball, though. Turns out that may just be the 
  truth. There is a free Bandage on the ground. You may head to the LEFT, or 
  greet the RAT.
