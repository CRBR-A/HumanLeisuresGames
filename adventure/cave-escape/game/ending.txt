  The phone is about to die. Its battery is at 3%, you have time for only one
  call. You dial 911 and quickly explain to the dispatcher where to look for 
  you. As you finish your story the phone cuts out and dies. There's nothing 
  left to do but wait.
  3 hours later, you hear some commotion. It's the rescue team here to save 
  you from this wretched cave!
  Congratulations you survived and beat the game!!
