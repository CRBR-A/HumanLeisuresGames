    from the east of where you're standing. 
  if flashlight & !keyCar:
    You are back in the mansion lobby...
    You can see a glittering key lying on the corner
    table to the north of you, and locate a dark
    hallway to the west. You are not sure where it leads. 
  if flashlight & keyCar:
    You are back in the mansion lobby...
    You already picked up the car keys here.
