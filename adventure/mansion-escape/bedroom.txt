look:
  You are in the master bedroom... 
  There is a question on the door to the bathroom.
  The question must be answered correctly for you to 
  get into the bathroom. The question on the door reads
  'What color is a ghost? Be alert. (this totally isn't 
  foreshadowing btw)' W-what? What an unsettling statement.
  At least, it's an easy question.
go
  north: 
    You must answer the question first to enter the bathroom.
    What color is a ghost?
    if "white":
      You hear a click, and the door opens. You pass through to the bathroom.

 east:
   You walk back into the hallway and to the lobby
   because it gives you the creeps.
