  if fifi:
    As you meander through the shop, Fifi becomes particularly intrigued by 
    an old gramophone. She tilts her head curiously, ears perked, as she 
    inspects the cone-shaped horn. Perhaps she's wondering if it might spring
    to life with a familiar voice.
  if !fifi:
    As you look around, you can't help but imagine how Fifi might react to 
    some of these oddities.
