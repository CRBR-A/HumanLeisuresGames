    Every corner of the shop holds treasures from the past. From old clocks
    to vintage jewelry, the collection is vast and fascinating.
    if fifi:
      As you meander through the shop, Fifi becomes particularly intrigued by 
      an old gramophone. She tilts her head curiously, ears perked, as she 
      inspects the cone-shaped horn. Perhaps she's wondering if it might
      spring to life with a familiar voice.

      As you look around, you can't help but imagine how Fifi might react to
      some of these oddities.
