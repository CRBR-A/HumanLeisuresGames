    The interior is serene and filled with soft lighting from stained glass
    windows. Wooden pews are neatly arranged facing a simple altar. A few
    individuals sit quietly, lost in reflection or prayer. The air is filled
    with a gentle scent of incense, and the overall atmosphere is one of
    peace and contemplation.

      The calm and peaceful ambiance of the sanctuary envelops you as you step
      in with Fifi. While some attendees give curious glances at the canine 
      visitor, most offer warm smiles, silently acknowledging the sanctuary's 
      all-inclusive welcome. Fifi, sensing the tranquility, calmly trots beside
      you, occasionally stopping to curiously sniff at the ends of pews. A 
      nearby attendee, observing Fifi, whispers, 'All creatures, great and 
      small, are welcome here.' You nod in appreciation, feeling grateful for
      such accepting spaces.
