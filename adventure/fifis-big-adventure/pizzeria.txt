    Oh no! A sudden gust sweeps up your dry cleaning ticket, sending it

  inside:
    As you step into the pizzeria, the warm ambiance envelops you. Red and
    white checkered tablecloths adorn the wooden tables. The walls are
    decorated with vintage Italian posters and the soft hum of conversations
    blends with the sizzle from the open kitchen. Chefs can be seen expertly
    tossing dough and assembling pizzas before sliding them into the stone
    oven.

      Fifi's nose twitches, clearly picking up on the delicious scent. As you 
      wait, the kid behind the counter winks at you and sneaks a small slice of
      cheese pizza to Fifi, who gobbles it down with glee. 'Dogs love our pizza 
      too!' the kid chuckles."
    if !fifi: >
      The pizzeria bustles with activity, the delicious scent of baking dough 
      and melting cheese pervading the atmosphere. You can't help but think how
      much Fifi would have loved the aroma. 
      As you look around, you notice the kid behind the counter playfully 
      interacting with customers.
