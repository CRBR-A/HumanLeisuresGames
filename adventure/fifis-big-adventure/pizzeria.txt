    Fifi's nose twitches, clearly picking up on the delicious scent. As you 
    wait, the kid behind the counter winks at you and sneaks a small slice of
    cheese pizza to Fifi, who gobbles it down with glee. 'Dogs love our pizza 
    too!' the kid chuckles."

    The pizzeria bustles with activity, the delicious scent of baking dough 
    and melting cheese pervading the atmosphere. You can't help but think how
    much Fifi would have loved the aroma. 
    As you look around, you notice the kid behind the counter playfully 
    interacting with customers.
