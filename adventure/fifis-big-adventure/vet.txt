    The moment you step into the vet's office, Fifi seems to sense where she
    is. Her tail goes between her legs, and she starts to whimper. Before you
    can comfort her, she suddenly pulls out of her collar and darts out the
    door. A vet assistant tries to catch her, but she's too quick. "She's
    probably just scared," the vet says reassuringly, "Most pets aren't fans
    of this place. You might want to look for her outside."

    The vet's office is filled with the soft mewls of cats and the occasional
    bark of dogs. You approach the receptionist and show her a picture of
    Fifi, asking if anyone has brought her in. She shakes her head, "Sorry,
    we haven't seen your dog. But leave your contact information, and we'll
    call if she shows up." You thank her and decide to continue your search
    outside.'
