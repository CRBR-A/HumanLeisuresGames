      As soon as you step inside with Fifi, a staff member approaches with a
      worried expression. 'Sorry, no pets allowed in the gym,' they say. Fifi
      looks around curiously, probably intrigued by all the moving machines.

      While looking around, you spot a lost wallet on the floor. After handing
      it over to the reception, the grateful owner rewards you for your
      honesty. You feel a bit richer now!

      The gym is bustling with activity. You observe people lifting weights,
      some are on treadmills, and a group is attending a yoga class. You admire
      their dedication, but then think to yourself, 'Who needs a gym when
      you're chasing after dogs all day?'
