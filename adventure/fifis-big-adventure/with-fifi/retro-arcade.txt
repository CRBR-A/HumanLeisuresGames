    Rows of vintage arcade machines line the walls, each game transporting
    players to different pixelated worlds. The familiar sounds of coin
    inserts, joystick moves, and victory jingles create an energetic
    symphony. In one corner, a high-score board boasts the legends of the
    arcade, and a snack bar offers refreshments and treats for players taking
    a break.

    Fifi seems fascinated by a claw machine filled with plush toys. She
    excitedly barks each time someone tries to grab a prize, cheering them on
    in her own way.

    You notice a 'Duck Hunt' arcade machine, with its iconic giggling dog. A
    wave of nostalgia washes over you, and thoughts of Fifi come rushing in. 
    How you wish she were beside you, much like the faithful hound in the game.
