  A Karaoke Bar's entrance is marked by a neon microphone sign, flickering to
  the beat of the latest pop hit. The faint sounds of enthusiastic (if not
  always pitch-perfect) singing can be heard from outside, combined with the
  occasional burst of laughter and applause.

    Karaoke Bar is dimly lit, with colorful stage lights casting a revolving
    glow on the main stage. Patrons sit at tables, sipping on drinks, while
    the brave ones take to the stage, belting out their chosen tunes. A large
    screen displays lyrics, and the walls are adorned with posters of iconic
    musicians and bands. The atmosphere is light-hearted and jovial, with
    everyone cheering on the performers, regardless of their singing prowess.

      As the next singer takes the stage to sing a particularly high note, Fifi
      joins in with an enthusiastic 'aroooo!' The crowd erupts in laughter and
      applause, clearly enjoying her impromptu duet. For a moment, Fifi seems
      to consider a career in music, her tail wagging to the rhythm."

      You can't help but get swept up in the music and the atmosphere of the 
      Karaoke Bar. As each performer takes the stage, you imagine how much fun
      it would be to share this experience with Fifi. Maybe she'd even have a
      favorite song?
