  There's a vet clinic here with a welcoming sign of a cat and dog. From
  inside, you can faintly hear the meows and barks of pets.
  Fifi becomes notably restless on this particular street corner. Her tail
  tucks slightly, and she pulls on the leash, eager to move away from the
  area.

    The vet's reception is calm and welcoming. A cat lounges in its carrier,
    and a dog wags its tail, waiting for a treat from the receptionist. The
    walls have posters about pet care.

      The moment you step into the vet's office, Fifi seems to sense where she
      is. Her tail goes between her legs, and she starts to whimper. Before you
      can comfort her, she suddenly pulls out of her collar and darts out the
      door. A vet assistant tries to catch her, but she's too quick. "She's
      probably just scared," the vet says reassuringly, "Most pets aren't fans
      of this place. You might want to look for her outside."

      The vet's office is filled with the soft mewls of cats and the occasional
      bark of dogs. You approach the receptionist and show her a picture of
      Fifi, asking if anyone has brought her in. She shakes her head, "Sorry,
      we haven't seen your dog. But leave your contact information, and we'll
      call if she shows up." You thank her and decide to continue your search
      outside.'
