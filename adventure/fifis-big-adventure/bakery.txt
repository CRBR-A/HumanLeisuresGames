    The bakery is filled with the delightful aroma of freshly baked goods. As
    you're admiring the pastries on display, a customer accidentally drops a
    cookie. Before you can react, Fifi, ever the opportunist, quickly snatches
    it up and munches on her unexpected treat. The customer laughs, 'Guess
    it's hers now!' You apologize, but they assure you it's alright. 'All
    part of the fun of having a dog,' they chuckle.
