    Inside the dog park's fence, there's a sense of joy and freedom. Dogs of
    all sizes run around, some chasing balls, others making new friends. A
    water station is set up for them to drink.

      You and Fifi enter the dog park, and her tail wags with excitement. She
      immediately joins a group of playful dogs, chasing a frisbee and rolling
      in the grass. After a while, you call her over, and she comes back,
      looking extremely happy. A fellow dog owner comments, 'She's got a lot of
      energy! It's great she has a place like this.'

      As you approach the dog park, you spot a familiar furry face. It's Fifi!
      She's playing joyfully with some other dogs. As you call out her name,
      she looks up and runs towards you, wagging her tail. It seems she's made
      some new friends while she was away. A nearby dog owner mentions, 'She's
      been the star of the park today!' You're relieved to have found her.
