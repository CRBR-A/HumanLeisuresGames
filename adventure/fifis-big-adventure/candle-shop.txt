  Nestled between two buildings is a quaint candle shop, its window adorned
  with candles of all shapes and colors. The gentle glow from within,
  combined with the soft fragrance wafting out, makes it an inviting location.

  inside:
    Inside the candle shop is a sensory delight. Shelves upon shelves of
    candles in every conceivable color and scent line the walls. Gentle music
    plays in the background, and the subtle intermingling of aromas - from
    lavender to fresh linen to sandalwood - creates a calming ambiance.

     Fifi seems particularly drawn to a section of uniquely scented candles. 
     To your amusement, she sniffs intently at a bacon-scented candle, her
     tail wagging in approval.

      While admiring a display of artisan candles, you notice one shaped like
      a small dog. It reminds you of Fifi, and you imagine her playful 
      curiosity in this fragrant wonderland.
