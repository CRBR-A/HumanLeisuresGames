    Fifi, recognizing the place from previous visits, immediately finds a
    comfy spot on the couch. She gives a contented sigh, clearly at ease in
    the familiar environment.
  if !fifi:
    The apartment feels a bit empty without Fifi's lively presence. You spot
    a chew toy she left behind during her last visit and hope to reunite her
    with it soon.
