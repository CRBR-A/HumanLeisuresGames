    You and Fifi walk into the dry cleaners. The clerk, recognizing Fifi,
    chuckles and says, 'Well, hello there. Helping with the chores today,

    You and Fifi enter the dry cleaners. The clerk smiles and greets Fifi
    warmly, 'Look who's here!' However, without a ticket, there's not much

    You step into the dry cleaners, but without a ticket, you quickly
    realize there's not much to do here. The hum of the machines and the
    soft chatter make it a peaceful place, though.
