      You and Fifi walk into the dry cleaners. The clerk, recognizing Fifi,
      chuckles and says, 'Well, hello there. Helping with the chores today,
      Fifi?' You hand over the ticket and receive your freshly cleaned
      clothes. They smell wonderful. Fifi sniffs them approvingly. 'No fur
      this time!' the clerk jokes.
    if !i_ticket:
      You and Fifi enter the dry cleaners. The clerk smiles and greets Fifi
      warmly, 'Look who's here!' However, without a ticket, there's not much
      to do. Fifi seems to enjoy the cool air and the chime of the doorbell.

      You walk into the dry cleaners and hand over your ticket. The clerk
      quickly retrieves your clothes, freshly cleaned and neatly folded. The
      scent of fresh laundry fills your nostrils. As you leave, you can't
      help but think how much Fifi would've enjoyed the outing.
    if !ticket: >
      You step into the dry cleaners, but without a ticket, you quickly
      realize there's not much to do here. The hum of the machines and the
      soft chatter make it a peaceful place, though.
