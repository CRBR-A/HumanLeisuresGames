# New Pieces
- empress : knight + rook
- amazon : knight + queen

# New rules
- antichess: lose all your pieces or get stalemated to win
- random chess: the starting position of the non-pawn pieces is random, and mirrored for both players (BUT: king must be between rooks, bishops on opposite colors)
- crazyhouse: drop a previous captured piece (converted to current player's color), on any empty square, instead of making a normal move
- duck chess: after each move, a duck is moved on a new empty square, and block it. No checks, players win by capturing the king.
- fog of war: players can only see squares what they can immediately move to
- horde chess: standard black pieces need to capture all 36 white pawns
- racing kings: both players start on the same side, the goal is to get one's king to the other side first

# New boards
- minichess: smaller chessboard (4x4, 4x8, 5x5...) with some pieces removed (ex: no bishops...) 
- 3 players: need special chessboard (with triangular, quadrilateral or hexagonal cells)
- 4 players: need special chessboard 
- 3D chess: playing with multiples "connected" chessboards (5x5x5, 8x8x8...)
- different board shapes
