# General tips
- learn some universal openings
- slight advantage for the white, due to moving first
  - White wins: 38% of games
  - Black wins: 34% of games
  - Draws: 28% of games
- try to control the 4 squares (D4, D5, E4, E5) in center of the board 
- use "forks" : attack multiples pieces simultaneously to ensure capture(s)
- use "pins" : force one piece to move and expose another one for capture
- try to block opponents pieces, instead of capturing them
- try to get all your pieces out and not blocked
- if multiple pieces can achieve something, use the weakest one
- always suppose your opponent will play the best move

# Pawns
- move slow (1 square, 2 at start), always forward
- weak alone, better in pairs, guarding each other
- useful for defense and blocking pieces
- extremely valuable if promoted
- "en passant" : capture a pawn and moving

# Knights
- goes out before bishops
- best placed near the center
- powerful, especially in pairs, guarding each other

# Bishops
- goes out after knights
- useful on the longest diagonals, and beginner opponents
- more valuable than knights, especially in pairs
- can trade one bishop for one opponent's knight
- can trade one bishop to break the opponent's pair of bishop

# Rooks
- useful with open columns
- useful on the opponent's pawns row (2nd or 7th rank)
- powerful, especially in pairs, guarding each other
- extremely powerful with the queen on the same open column
- castle very early (but not too early)

# Queen
- don't move the queen too early
- extremely powerful with the rooks, on the same open column

# King
- King safety is extremely important until endgame
- always have an escape route for your king
- castle very early (but not too early)
- watch out for back rank checkmates
- later in the game, king joins the battle, after the queen
