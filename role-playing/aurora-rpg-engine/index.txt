The **Aurora RPG Engine** is released under a CC0 license.

Technically, the above is not strictly necessary as in many countries
games rules are not copyrightable.  And, certainly, I am standing on the
shoulders of giants, both building from and borrowing from many other
games over the years.  I include it just to be clear that you are free
to take and use this RPG core engine however you wish.  I hope it proves
to be wonderful for you and helps you create an amazing campaign\!

That said, if you would like to use the Aurora RPG Engine in your game,
I would love it if you would let me know, and be delighted if you
included attribution to me, Oliver "Kannik" Bollmann.  And if it will be
published, I'd love it even more if you'd involve me in the project\! 
Either way, if you'd like to contact me please use any of the contact
means listed in the sidebar to the right.


Thank you and happy gaming\!
