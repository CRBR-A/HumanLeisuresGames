## The Aurora RPG Engine – Part 13

## Postscript 4 – MoS Counting

It's somewhat thorny to get an idea of an average numerical value for
MoS that includes the possibility of failure, since both failure and an
MoS of 0 calculate as zero.  However, if we look at mechanics for using
MoS either in cumulative or extended tasks, or when it is used to
determine damage or an outcome against an opponent, we can calculate
some useful guidelines (and get a window on how to use those values in
our game).

There are two prime methods to use MoS in this way.  The first is to
have a success (MoS of 0) count as 1, plus 1 additional per point of
MoS.  So a success with an MoS of 2 would result in a value of 3,
whether that be 3 points of damage/effect, or 3 points added to the
cumulative pool towards completing a task or achieving an aim.

Using this, we can determine the average MoS expected for a particular
dice pool that includes failure:

|         | 3d   | 3.5d | 4d   | 4.5d | 5d   | 5.5d | 6d   | 6.5d | 7d   | 7.5d | 8d   |
| ------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Avg Val | 0.09 | 0.43 | 0.68 | 1.42 | 1.82 | 2.83 | 3.16 | 4.21 | 4.44 | 5.47 | 5.62 |

An alternate way is [to re-work the success ladder presented
earlier](https://lynxthoughts.com/2020/02/26/the-aurora-rpg-engine-part-7/)
to make an MoS of 0 a little more precarious by making it a Minimal
success:

| MoS | Quality of Result |
| --- | ----------------- |
| 0   | Minimal Success   |
| 1   | Solid Success     |
| 2   | Notable Success   |
| 3   | Brilliant Success |
| 4   | Stunning Success  |
| 5   | Sublime Success   |
| 6   | Legendary Success |

Thus a Minimal success is a case where the character has just, barely,
succeeded at the task.  For example:
- If a character is leaping between buildings, their foot lands right
  on the edge of the parapet. They made it, but their heart is
  certainly beating hard now\!
- If this leap was part of a chase, it may cause them to stumble a
  bit, which, depending on how their quarry rolls, might make them
  lose a bit of ground.
- If the character was attempting to haggle for an item, they only
  manage to get a minor discount.
- If the character was researching something, they confirm its
  existence and the overall, general information about the thing, but
  nothing very detailed.
- If the character was fixing an engine, they get it running in the
  nick of time, but it was looking dodgy right up until the last
  moment\!

This is opposed to the next rung up the ladder, where a Solid success is
an unambiguous one:  a character lands firmly on the roof beyond the
parapet; they achieve a worthy discount; they gain a new piece knowledge
that will aid them going forward, or they get things running and are
sure that things won't break again.

The value of making a distinction between Minimal and Solid success is
mostly one of RP – it's to narrate a bare success.  It also helps to
make each of the levels above a Solid success more distinct and thus
easier for the GM to craft mechanical and narratively appropriate
outcomes (and thus also more RP-rich).

Minimal success can also be used to tweak the cumulative/damage
mechanics by having the value be equal to the MoS, with the special case
that an MoS of 0 counts as a value of ½.  This makes things more elegant
and straightforward\* to calculate as there's a more direct line between
the MoS and the value (when compared to calculating it as the 1 + MoS
method above).

Using this Minimal success method, here is the matrix to determine the
average MoS expected for a particular dice pool:

|         | 3d   | 3.5d | 4d   | 4.5d | 5d  | 5.5d | 6d   | 6.5d | 7d   | 7.5d | 8d   |
| ------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Avg MoS | 0.05 | 0.21 | 0.34 | 0.83 | 1.1 | 1.96 | 2.24 | 3.24 | 3.46 | 4.48 | 4.63 |

\*While keeping track of ½ points of success might seem to add back some
inelegance, but as the system is already tracking ½ values for the dice
pool the context for ½ points already exists.  Much like modifiers
described above, it could be recorded using boxes, where a ½ result is
marked by placing a single slash in the box and a full point is marked
either with an X in the box or by completely filling in the box.
