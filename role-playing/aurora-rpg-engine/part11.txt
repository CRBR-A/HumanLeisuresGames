## The Aurora RPG Engine – Part 11

## Postscript – Breaking the Core Mechanic (In a Good Way)

Sometimes, hooking a sub-system onto the core isn't quite enough to
model the intricacies of a particular genre.  Sometimes you just gotta
directly hack the core.  Here's one example of how this can work well
when carefully applied, centering around the fixed target
number.

**Friction.**
This concept is borrowed from the Top Secret/NWO game and
models how something as touchy and fraught as spy-type (or detective
noir, or covert military operations, or similar) action can be, as every
little complication during a mission adds up, compounding and
threatening to spiral everything out of control.  This is represented by
the addition of a Tension Track to the game.  For every failed task, and
as an option when buying additional dice from the GM, the tension track
is increased by one.  For every 3 ticks upward on the track, the base
target number also clicks up by one:  16, 17, 18.  With this, not only
does it model the characters having a tougher time to succeed due both
to the complications as well as their mounting psychological stress, but
the players themselves also notice the higher base value and thus begin
to feel under pressure.  As the mission progresses, the tension mounts...

But not forever.  MoS can be used to click back the Tension Track,
offering a new choice to the gameplay:  should I succeed greatly here,
or buy an advantage, or should I use this MoS to click back how
pear-shaped the mission has far being going thus far?


**Why this works.**
After so many words describing how the fixed target
number is a great feature of Aurora's core mechanic, the adjustment of
the target number works in this context because it is an
across-the-board sliding of the target number and not an individual
test-by-test adjustment.  Therefore most of the benefits of a fixed
target number remain, and if the uncertainty of one's chances of success
get a little wonky because it no longer fits the standard values that's
actually a bonus and not a bug, for it fits the genre perfectly to
intentionally add uncertainty and tension.
