## The Aurora RPG Engine – Part 6

## Handling Difficulty and Modifiers

As already noted for the reasons mentioned above, the baseline
difficulty of a task as well as pertinent modifiers are handled by
adjusting the dice pool, adding or subtracting dice in ½d increments. 
The target number (15) remains the same.

**Nomenclature.**  
What to call this up and down travel through half
dice increments?  While there are many nice and elegant names that can
be chosen to fit and reinforce the genre, theme, and tone of a specific
campaign, in this document I will generically refer to it as *stepping*
up and down the *dice* or *difficulty ladder*.


**Setting Difficulties:  The Difficulty Ladder.** 
To borrow the
approach commonly used across many (and perhaps most) RPGs, a task's
difficulty is set and handled by the GM determining the baseline
difficulty based on a descriptive chart:

| Task Difficulty         | Pool Modifier   | Modifier in Steps |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Trivial                 | \+2d            | 3 to 4 steps      |
| Easy                    | \+1d            | 1 to 2 steps      |
| Routine                 | \+0d            | No change         |
| Challenging             | \-1d            | 1 to 2 steps      |
| Intense                 | \-2d            | 3 to 4 steps      |
| Formidable              | \-3d            | 5 to 6 steps      |
| Severe                  | \-4d            | 7 to 8 steps      |
| Insane                  | \-5d            | 9 to 10 steps     |
| Herculean (Heroic/Epic) | \-6d or greater | 11+ steps         |

(Just another reminder that, compared to most other games, it is the
character's *dice pool* that is adjusted via stepping rather than
setting a *base target number*.)

For a more "narrative" style of play (as is done, for example, in the
FATE system) this same chart and nomenclature is used to set both the
baseline difficulty as well as any situational modifiers.  Here, the
table serves double duty in a conversation between the GM and the
player(s) to determine the final difficulty:  "You are going to jump
across the wide ravine while it is dark and raining, but you have a good
running start and are wearing your lucky underwear.  Still sounds quite
formidable, step down 5 or 2½ dice."

Using a more "traditional" procedure, once the baseline difficulty is
determined (using the baseline difficulty chart) the total pool is
further adjusted using modifiers from a list of standard situational
modifiers – for example, Lightly Obscured = -1 shift; Heavily Obscured =
-3 shifts; Totally Obscured = -5 shifts.  With a robust and extensive
enough list of modifiers, a very granular game system can easily be
created if appropriate and desired.

Either way, there is no need to re-invent the wheel, and the familiar
difficulty-setting method can be used in Aurora's core resolution engine
quite easily.

**Easy and Trivial Tasks?** 
It is recommended that skill rolls be
called for only when a task requires some degree of skill or ability to
do properly (following directions on a map in a city as a tourist is
generally not a skill roll), is narratively interesting (there's
something relevant that can arise from failure or there is something to
be gained knowing how well a task is performed) and/or there is
something out of the ordinary or dramatic about the situation.  Thus,
though they are on the list, Easy or Trivial skill tests are likely to
be infrequent except in unusual circumstances or when circumstances
inject extra adversity and thus uncertainty.  Then again, adventurers
often find themselves in very unusual circumstances while also under
duress so... maybe in the end Easy/Trivial rolls won't be that infrequent
(albeit often with a lot of other modifiers piled on top).

**Setting Difficulties:  Using Traits, Aspects, and Tags. ** 
That said,
if we want to add new wheels to the idea, the notion of modifiers can be
expanded to invoke the idea of Aspects or Traits [as detailed in this
earlier blog
post](https://lynxthoughts.com/2018/02/08/gaming-thursday-tasks-difficulties-and-aspects/)
and as used in games such as FATE and Modiphius' Star Trek Adventures. 
To briefly summarize the linked blog post, a Trait, Aspect, or Tag is a
phrase or label that describes and denotes something (usually out of the
ordinary or special) about a person, object, or scene to which it is
attached.

If a case can be made that the Trait or Aspect applies to the
action/event, then it may affect a test/roll in two ways:
- It may allow (or disallow) something that normally would (or would
  not) be possible.
- It may affect the difficulty of the task, adding or subtracting dice
  to the pool depending whether it helps or hinders.

Using this idea, there is no list of standard situational modifiers. 
Instead, once the base pool is determined, any and all applicable
Aspects, Traits, or Tags are factored in one by one until the final dice
pool is created.  How much of a modifier each Trait or Aspect provides
to making a test depends on how relevant or important it is and its
magnitude of impact.  Some of these will be highly situational, while
others, such as the strength of a lock or the impact of fog, will be
more common within a more fixed range.  These can be noted on the table
with a card denoting the magnitude (and thus number of shifts) using
dots or boxes next to the Aspect.  For example:  Lock ■ ■ □ (where each
filled box is a full die, and a white box is a half die), or Lock ●●●●●
(where each dot is a step).

Altogether, this provides greater flexibility and range of effect than a
set table of modifiers, making for a richer set of choices and enhancing
player involvement.


**The Double-Edged Nature (In a Good Way) of Traits.**
One of the nice
things about applying Traits, Aspects, or Tags (versus a rigid list of
modifiers) is that many of them will be of a dual nature, acting
alternately as hinderance as well as able to be leveraged for advantage
by the characters.  For example, while a Trait of "Very Foggy" makes it
more difficult to aim and therefore more difficult to hit things in
ranged combat, at the same time the fog makes it easier to sneak around
or to stealth away.  More creatively, if I'm on fire, I can leverage
that trait to more easily put out the flames as everything around me
would be damp.  (Still, it's likely best advised to avoid being set on
fire in the first place...)

This double nature becomes even more important if the Aspect, Trait, or
Tag is part of a character's background, concept, values, disposition,
or similar.  As in FATE, Cortex Prime (using Distinctions), and to an
extent in Star Trek Adventures (using Values), traits can be used to
both aid and appropriately hinder a character to create interesting
narrative situations and complications while fostering greater RP
opportunities.


**How to Handle the ½d to Avoid Confusion.**
How best to remember which
die in a pool is the ½ die (d3) and avoid the (almost inevitable) "Wait,
which one was it?" conversation?  As no more than a single ½d is ever
required as part of a pool, here are a few options:
- Each player chooses a die, unique in some way (colour, style, size,
  etc), to always be their ½ die.
- Set a table rule, for example, "Blue dice are always counted as the
  d3."
- A single die is designated as the d3 die, to be shared by all the
  players.
- The group invests in buying (or 3D printing) a few of the
  fancily-shaped d3s that are available on the market, and use those
  when rolling a ½d.
