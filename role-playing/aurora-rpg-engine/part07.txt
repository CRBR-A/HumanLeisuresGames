## The "Extra Die" Beauty: Creating a Margin of Success

Now we get to the key idea that really makes Aurora sing:  After
tallying enough dice to reach the target number of 15, any "remaining"
dice count (as in counting the number of dice themselves, not the
numbers on the dice) as the Margin of Success (hereafter often noted as
MoS).

With this innovation\*, a Margin of Success mechanic is elegantly added
to a dice pool system that keeps things moving quickly and, most
importantly, preserves the pool's visceral nature.  By dealing in dice
(and by having/keeping a fixed target number), there's no need to
calculate something fiddly such as "for every 5 points over the target
number you have achieved an extra level of success."  Count out to 15,
move the rest of the dice to the side, and there's the Margin of
Success.

With this, the many great options and advantages of a Margin of Success
system open up:

- Provides for more interesting narrative outcomes. With an explicit
  MoS system, the players and GM know not only if the character
  succeeds or fails, but also how well or by how much.  Did they just
  narrowly make it?  Succeed with style?  Fail miserably?  Or did they
  shine in a moment of glory?  This gives everyone a tool to create
  and craft a rich and more exciting scene and story.
- AND, using the "Buying Success" mechanic detailed in the next
  section, it allows for tension, excitement, and a great story even
  if the character fails or just ekes out a win.
- Allows for the easy creation of cumulative or extended tasks,
  compiling a count of MoS towards completing a goal.
- Explicitly allows the coupling of success in combat (or other
  conflicts) with the skill roll, avoiding the oddities (and often
  frustration) of excellent to-hit rolls yet terrible damage rolls, or
  vice versa. This makes the skill roll more important and thus makes
  character ability and agency more relevant.
- By leveraging MoS as a type of "currency," interesting subsystems
  can be added, such as spending MoS to activate special abilities,
  create advantages, or other creative and exciting outcomes.


**\* Innovation?**  
This idea of counting "Extra Dice" is what broke my
mental logjam and ended my multi-year pursuit through various (and
increasingly complex) dice systems to handle all the aspects I wanted in
my game system, especially the inclusion of an elegant way to determine
Margin of Success within a dice pool.  It also provides for the very
nifty inversion of the idea, using the same mechanics and values as the
results from the MoS, only flipped, to "buy" success at a cost (which is
detailed in "The Twist," below).

This idea is the crux of Aurora and I'm excited that it came to me.  AND
I'm putting an asterisk next to the word "innovation" for I know there
are countless game systems out there, and while I don't recall seeing
this idea used in this manner before I'm not so arrogant as to believe
that I must be the only person to ever dream it up.  So to all of us who
have had this idea, it's a great idea and innovation\!


**Handling MoS:  The Success Ladder.** 
As used (and perhaps pioneered)
in the old James Bond RPG by Victory Games, as well as the FATE system
and, to some degree, DP9's Silhouette system, MoS can be handled in a
narrative fashion to play out the results of a test.

For example, to pull from the FATE ladder:

| MoS | Quality of Result |
| --- | ----------------- |
| 0   | Fair              |
| 1   | Good              |
| 2   | Great             |
| 3   | Superb            |
| 4   | Fantastic         |
| 5   | Epic              |
| 6   | Legendary         |

Alternately, it could be written like this:

| MoS | Quality of Result    |
| --- | -------------------- |
| 0   | Unremarkable Success |
| 1   | Notable Success      |
| 2   | Absolute Success     |
| 3   | Brilliant Success    |
| 4   | Stunning Success     |
| 5   | Sublime Success      |
| 6   | Legendary Success    |

Used as a narrative result, the impact of these results on a given
situation or outcome is left up to the GM and players in the spur of the
moment.  Suggestions include the task taking less time, requiring less
resources, obtaining additional or sizable and spectacular results,
gaining narrative advantages, gaining additional information, or
influencing NPC actions, dispositions, or reactions.  If, as in the
James Bond RPG, the same results are also used to determine success in a
conflict, high results could also indicate taking out multiple or
stronger opponents.

**Handling MoS:  MoS as Currency.**
Beyond a purely narrative
construct, MoS can also be used as a form of "currency" that allows a
player to "purchase" and guide the outcome of their extraordinary
success at a task.  This is used in Modiphius' 2d20 system (spending
Momentum) and, of a fashion, in FFG's Star Wars/Genesys system (spending
Advantage).  DP9's Silhouette system also used parts of this idea,
especially towards damage during conflicts.

For example, as a very basic list:

| Cost | Benefit                                                                                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Damage:  When attacking someone, deal an extra point of damage. (Repeatable)                                                         |
| 1    | Great Success:  Improve the task outcome (Repeatable:  +15%/30%/50%/70%/90%)                                                         |
| 1    | Great Success:  Reduce time required to perform the task (Repeatable:  -15%/30%/50%/70%/90%)                                         |
| 1    | Great Success:  Reduce resources required to perform the task (Repeatable:  -15%/30%/50%/70%/90%)                                    |
| 1    | Boon:  Add an appropriate Trait/Aspect to the scene or character that lasts until the end of your next turn.                         |
| 3    | Create Advantage:  Add an appropriate Trait/Aspect to the scene or character that lasts until the end of the scene.                  |
| 5    | Asset or Leverage:  Gain an appropriate and "permanent" Trait/Aspect or Asset going forward for the remainder of the episode.        |
| 3    | Remove Complication:  Remove or nullify an appropriate Trait/Aspect on the scene or character that lasts until the end of the scene. |
| 2    | Disarm:  One item or weapon held by the target is knocked away.                                                                      |
| 4    | Swift Task:  Perform an additional action at no die penalty.                                                                         |

(With a brief reminder that the values on the above list have not been
playtested...)

In addition, certain games and genres could also include special
abilities, feats, or stunts that are activated by spending points of
MoS.  Martial arts moves and maneuvers (especially wuxia-like ones) are
a prime example of where this could be used.

**Purchasing Outcomes.**
Having played in a few games that use this
type of success economy, this concept can be very exciting and of great
help to create amusing, nifty, and memorable results, all through player
choice.  Sometimes I may just want the maximum damage or skill outcome
possible, but other times, and even often, setting up an advantage or
creating narrative hooks can be more important to success, not to
mention supremely rewarding for the story being created through play.

**MoS Options:  Collective MoS Pool.**
To borrow from the Momentum Pool
idea/mechanic that is used in Modiphius' Star Trek Adventures, any
"leftover" MoS that has not been spent to purchase outcomes can be
added to a common MoS pool, up to a certain cap.  Later, any character
can pull these stored MoS dice from the pool to purchase outcomes as
though they had generated the MoS themselves during their roll.
