## The Aurora RPG Engine – Part 2

## Intentions and Advantages of the Aurora RPG Engine

- Delightfully visceral, with an intuitively graspable chance of
  success and strong emotional engagement.
- Uncomplicated and minimal math plus easy handling of modifiers makes
  for a quick and efficient resolution system.
- In a clean and innovative way, outcomes generate a Margin of Success
  or Failure that tie both into crunchy rule impacts and/or narrative
  boons, banes, and effects.
- Easy to hack and customize to suit a campaign's specific needs in
  terms of genre, tone, feel, and playstyle.
- Emphasizes player choice and agency, allowing for greater options,
  engagement, excitement, and storytelling oomph.

## Aurora's Core Resolution Engine Building Blocks

- The task resolution mechanic is d6 pool system.
  - All die values in the game are written without the 6 on d6, as
    there are no other dice. For example: 5d.
  - Values are (generally) stepped up or down in ½d increments: 4d,
    4½d, 5d, etc.
  - A ½d is a d3.
- Values on the character sheet determine the base pool.
  - Exactly what these values are, and what they represent, varies
    depending on the genre, style, and tone of the campaign.
  - Most games will use a combination of values to generate the base
    pool.
  - Common value groupings include:
    - Attributes
    - Skills
    - Styles
    - Roles
    - Backgrounds
    - Approaches
    - Aptitudes
    - Traits/Aspects/Distinctions/Tags
  - Values are (generally) rated in ½d increments.
- The base number of dice for a skilled entry-level professional is
  5d.
  - Consider: "If this was someone's profession, and they had a year
    or two in that profession, would this be considered regularly
    doable? Would this be in their wheelhouse?"  If so, this is the
    baseline of 5 dice.
  - A higher level of skill, experience, or capability is
    represented by a base number of dice greater than 5.
  - Likewise, a lower level of skill, experience, or capability is
    represented by a base number of dice less than 5.
- This base pool is adjusted.
  - Tasks of greater or lesser difficulty are handled by adding or
    subtracting dice from the character's base pool.
  - External and contextual modifiers to the task (for equipment,
    environment, situation, injuries, etc) are also handled by
    adding or subtracting dice from the character's base pool.
  - Modifiers are (generally) applied in ½d increments.
  - Therefore, the total pool rolled (generally) equals the Base
    Values ± Difficulty Modifier ± All External & Contextual
    Modifiers.
- The target number of the roll is <span class="underline">15</span>.
  - This number is fixed; as above, tasks of greater or lesser
    difficulty, as well as external and contextual modifiers to the
    task, are handled by adding and subtracting dice from the
    character's base pool, not by increasing or decreasing the
    target number.
- Rolls that total or exceed the target number of 15 count as a
  success.
  - "Extra" dice (the number of dice remaining after totalling
    enough dice to equal 15) count as the Margin of Success.
  - These Margin of Success dice are then used to gain superior
    outcomes, including narrative favour, creating advantages, extra
    effect(s), etc.
- Rolls that total less than the target number count as a failure.
  - "Extra" dice can be bought (one by one) to be rolled and added
    to the total to succeed "at cost" by incurring setbacks,
    including narrative disfavour, disadvantages, troubles,
    complications, etc.


**Influences and Inspirations.**  Over my 35+ years of gaming I've
played dozens of different RPG systems and read (though not played)
countless more.  As can be expected, every one of them has influenced me
in some way.  But there are a couple of games that clearly play an
outsized role in inspiring Aurora:

The first and most noticeable being West End Games' d6 system, as
originally presented in their Star Wars games.  It is from here that the
base functionality of the dice pool derives and forms the glowing heart
of this game engine (albeit with an innovative twist that I think both
strengthens its inherent advantages as well as creating further
advantages).\*

The second is the Silhouette system by Dream Pod 9.  A flexible and
effects-based system, it introduced me to many ideas, most especially
the great concept and utility of a "Margin of Success/Failure."

The third, as [I began to describe in this earlier blog
post](https://lynxthoughts.com/2016/01/28/gaming-thursday-rpg-system-x-timeout/),
is the current crop of what could be termed (though I am cautious of the
reductiveness pitfall in using such labels) more "narrative-based"
games, with FATE and Cortex Plus/Prime being the most noticeable and
influential.  There are a lot of ideas and aspects within Aurora that
very much fall in line with what's being created in both Cortex and
FATE.

\* This is especially poignant as the founder of WEG and creator of the
d6 system, Daniel Scott Palter, [unfortunately has just passed
away](https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/45207/r-i-p-daniel-scott-palter). 
A big debt of gratitude to him for his all his work in the RPG industry,
creating not only the amazing d6 ruleset but also an astounding volume
of work done to keep and expand the Star Wars universe and lore during a
time when the franchise was dormant in the popular media sphere.


**The Drop-In Factor**.  One of the great things about systems such as
FATE, Cortex Prime, or Savage Worlds, is how they are designed to be
modular and flexible.  As such, they are a treasure chest of ideas and
game rules that can be "easily" imported, adopted, and attached to the
Aurora core resolution system in order to create a full game system that
suits the tone, style, and feel of the campaign.  Alternately, there is
the option to use those systems as the base and swap out their
resolution system with Aurora's to incorporate the advantages it
brings.  This is especially true (and "easy") with Cortex Prime, for it
as well is explicitly developed as toolkit, based around its own core
resolution ideas.
