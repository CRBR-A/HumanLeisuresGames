## The Aurora RPG Engine – Part 9

## Creating the Base Pool

After going through nearly the entirety of the resolution system and
outlining the bits that happen once the base pool has been gathered,
it's well past time to cover how that base pool, and its baseline
value of 5 dice, is generated.  This is no trivial matter.  As every
test or roll made by a character begins with these values, what gets
included, measured, and listed on the character sheet not only defines
that character but also has a huge influence on the overall genre, tone,
and playstyle of the entire game/campaign.  These values say what's
important about the characters, and thus what's important about the
game.  They influence how the players view the characters, how they
approach things, and what kinds of actions they will take.  They provide
flavour and guidance and ultimately are the lens through which the
players/characters know themselves.  All in all, the way characters are
measured and defined is one of the most important choices in designing
the campaign.<span id="more-6687"></span>

Whether the base pool is generated from a combination of characteristics
(such as Attributes + Skills) or a single one (such as Approaches), the
key to assigning value ranges is remembering that the intent is to
provide a baseline of 5 dice for an entry level professional in that
field.  Thus, in games with a combination of characteristics, each
characteristic will be in the range of 1-3 dice each, while for single
characteristic games the range will be higher, on the order of 3-6 dice
per characteristic.

Furthermore, in games where the characters begin as professionals, the
total values should be assigned such that they are rocking 5 dice total
when doing something in their wheelhouse, with perhaps six dice if they
are extra specialists in that area or if they have a narrative-based
Aspect that applies, and with less dice in the areas where they are
weaker.  If the campaign instead begins with the characters as novices,
they may only have 3 to 4 dice in their particular areas of
semi-expertise.  If they begin as veterans, and as they progress and
gain more experience, they likewise begin with and gain larger and
larger base pools.

**Characteristics, Attributes, Approaches, and More**.
There are dozens
upon dozens (upon dozens\!) of examples to pull from other RPGs as
possible systems to use to categorize, measure, and ultimately define a
character.  Even inside similar system models, such as the classic
Attribute + Skills, how many attributes are characterized and what each
one represents (plus how many skills are enumerated and how general or
specific each one is) makes a big difference in how the game plays and
how the world/campaign feels.  Using three broad stats feels very
different than using 12 "precise" ones, and even with 12 "precise"
values if more stats detail physical attributes than spiritual wellbeing
or social interaction it signals what the game considers important and,
as such, the campaign will gravitate towards those certain actions and
the accompanying playstyle, focus, and feel.

All in all, this is a way of saying that while some ideas are presented
below, they are by no means exhaustive.   The Cortex Prime SRD (when
it's fully released...) is a great resource here as well as an example,
for it too dives into a multitude of options for attributes/etc and
discusses using them in combinations with its own core resolution
system/idea.

**Attribute + Skill.**
The classic construction for an RPG character,
useful for many game styles and genres.\*  For games and genres where
distinct expertise is considered important, skill values should be
emphasized, with 3d being considered as the value for a trained skill,
leaving the "average" attribute to have a value of 2d in order to total
five dice.  For campaigns that emphasize more broadly capable
characters, reverse the two, with 3d for an average attribute, and 2d
for a trained skill.

\*Also very appropriate, given my musings that began this whole
multi-year journey towards this new RPG system started with a [nifty
idea for a matrix of
attributes](https://lynxthoughts.com/2014/02/17/rpg-system-1-attributes/)...


**Attributes + Departments/Areas of Expertise.**
This way replaces
individualized and distinct skills with broad categories tied together
as a particular role, department, branch, or otherwise grouped area of
expertise.  This is great for genres where character roles are
emphasized, such as the military or other department-heavy organizations
(for example, Starfleet within Star Trek), genres with distinct
archetypes (fantasy, heist-type campaigns, or a Firefly game), or genres
with broad and reoccurring elements (superspies and spycraftian games).

One of the additional benefits of using this grouping is that with the
proper naming for each of the roles, departments, or areas of expertise,
it really sets and supports the tone and mood of the game.  Top
Secret/NWO uses an Attribute + Tradecraft system, and many of their
names are deliciously flavourful:  Nerve, Suave, Pulse, Intellect, and
Reflex for the attributes, and with Sigint, Huminint, Techint, and
Combat for the tradecraft categories.

**.... + Background.**
If the mechanism of Aspects is being included in the
game, then the addition of a Background, Core Concept, "One unique
thing" (to borrow from 13<sup>th</sup> Age), or similar all provide
another way of defining a character.  Often, these aspects will only
come into play at dramatically appropriate times, adding a boost (or
hindrance\!) in great story-defining ways; as such their impact will be
relatively infrequent and so can be considered separate from needing to
be balanced into the base pool of 5 dice.

If, instead, these Aspects are intended to be broad and important enough
to include in many or nearly all base pools, then consider their
contribution while determining the contribution from the rest of the
values that create the base pool of 5 dice.


**Approaches + Aspects.**
Taken from FATE Accelerated, characters are
defined by how they solve and overcome challenges rather than on
specific means and methods:  Forceful, Quick, Clever, Sneaky, Flashy,
and Careful.  Apocalypse World games also use something similar, as did
the old D20 modern with its "classes" based around one of the six
traditional D\&D attributes: strong, fast, tough, smart, dedicated,
charismatic (or more poetically written: slick, brawny, nimble, canny,
etc).  These receive the bulk of the weight to create the base pool of 5
dice, supported and supplemented by a handful of character Aspects.


**Stunts and Feats.**
While they usually do not impact the base pool,
Stunts or Feats are another common way to customize characters to
provide interesting abilities and special effects by breaking or
tweaking the game rules in interesting ways under certain
circumstances.  Both FATE and Cortex Prime give great examples on how
to build these in a general (but still impactful and flavourful) way,
and any game with Talents, Feats, and the like can be cribbed for nice
abilities and features to add to a character to render them capable in
uncommon ways.
