The Shadowdancer

No two dungeons are alike, yet they all have one thing
in common - a plethora of shadowy recesses. Those
recesses are a playground for the shadowdancer,
who is able to teleport between shadows. The brief
glimpses to be had of her in combat reveal a graceful
dance that leaves her opponents dying for more.

The shadowdancer is CLEVER, but IMPATIENT.
She seeks THRILLS on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Can teleport between shadows.

OFFENSIVE MOVES:
- dance of death
- shadowstrike
- deeper shadows

DEFENSIVE MOVES:

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find her to be
carrying rhythmic daggers, a light-banishing cape, a
muffling mask, a shadow bomb, lenses of day-sight,
gloves of umbral grasp, sonata sandals, or tattered
children's ballet slippers.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, she might spill her guts about a
place where shadows lead deeper or when the
princess has dance practice.
