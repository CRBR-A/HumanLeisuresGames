The Lancer

The lancer picked up her skills during her service in
the Elven military. She retired early and with honors,
but never found the truly worthy opponent she
longed for. To satisfy that longing, her retirement
consists of finding dungeons and spearing her way
to the center, where she hopes able warriors await.

The lancer is CONFIDENT, but IMPATIENT.
She seeks CHALLENGE on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Excels at keeping enemies at a distance.

OFFENSIVE MOVES:
- spear flurry
- impressive display
- precision throw

DEFENSIVE MOVES:
- leg sweep
- warning slash
- pin enemy

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find her to
be carrying a helm of precision, a dashing cape,
a thrusting pauldron, a vorpal glaive, barbed
short spears, a light sash, no-slip boots, launching
gauntlets, or an ornate lighter.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, she might spill her guts about
military operations, an elven treasure, or a magic
weaponsmith.
