The Mage Hunter

After seeing his parents stab each other to death
because a zealot of the false god Melawa influenced
their minds, the mage hunter dedicated his life to
training to negate such blasphemies. Now, not only
can he nullify magic, he can absorb it, redirect it,
and even smell it when it's cast nearby.

The mage hunter is PERSISTENT, but BRASH.
He seeks VENGEANCE on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Is nearly immune to magic.

OFFENSIVE MOVES:
- anti-magic zone
- smell magic
- crushing hammer

DEFENSIVE MOVES
- swallow magic
- redirect spell
- snatch magic focus

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find him to be
carrying magic focus trophies, a safe-thought helm,
a null-weave tunic, spellgrab gauntlets, firecrackers,
a poison of speechlessness, or a stellar alloy hammer
with rites carved into it.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about a
place where magic naturally wanes, a magic
resistant mineral, or a powerful monster mage.
