The Monk

Through the most intense physical and mental
training, the monk has removed all traces of
weakness from his body. Determined to push
himself to even greater limits, he has been known
to clear entire dungeons with just blinding fast
punches and devastating, acrobatic kicks.

The monk is STEADY, but STUBBORN.
He seeks CHALLENGE on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Can run on walls and across water.

OFFENSIVE MOVES
- relentless flurry
- leaping strike
- meditation

DEFENSIVE MOVES
- intense focus
- impressive dodge
- bear the pain

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find him to be
carrying a conical hat of focus, chakra tassels, speed
wraps, a sash of balance, chi-bolstering green tea,
beads of contemplation, monastic texts, or an erhu
worn from use.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about a
mountain temple, a scroll of spiritual awakening,
or an entombed army.
