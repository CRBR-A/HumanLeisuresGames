The Eldritch Warrior

Eldritch training can only be bought with monster
ears, so the eldritch warrior throws himself against
the toughest of them to earn training in his art.
Arcane practice lends him enhanced movement and
the ability to summon magic blades, so although he
wears no weapons, he is always carrying many.

The eldritch warrior is OPTIMISTIC, but COCKY.
He seeks CHALLENGE on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Can summon a powerful magic sword at-will.

OFFENSIVE MOVES:
- floating daggers
- blinding flash
- magical leap

DEFENSIVE MOVES:
- blurred visage
- blink step
- blade shield

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find him to be
carrying an intimidating mask, a magefiber tunic,
blinkstep boots, a bag of monster ears, a scroll of
phantom blade, a luck relic, or a locket containing
an image of an ugly young elf.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about other
powerful monsters, an arcane armory, or an
ancient ritual.
