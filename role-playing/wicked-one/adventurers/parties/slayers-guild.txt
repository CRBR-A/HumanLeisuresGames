Members:
- Tetra Nabin, The Alchemist
- Daerik Podayr, The Eldritch Warrior 
- Ty Rondin, The Scout

Origin story: A Strange Invitation
Having heard of their effectiveness, Daerik
offered Ty and Tetra gold and treasure in
exchange for helping him gather monster
ears. Bewildered by the mission, but always
up for some gold, they joined him on a hunt. It
quickly became apparent that this would be a
gainful relationship for all - they get their gold
and Daerik gets the ears he needs to pay for
further Eldritch training.

Recent adventure: Spinning Blades
While helping defend a hamlet against orc
raids, Ty and Tetra got pinned down. Heavily
outnumbered, Daerik still managed to cleave
through and drive off the orc band.

Tactics: Track, Bomb, Rush
When approaching a monster's domain, Ty
takes his time to find the best way in. Staying
quiet ensures that Tetra can make the most
out of whatever nasty conction she decides
to lob at the unsuspecting beasts. As soon as
the plan is underway, the two fall back and
lay down cover as Daerik springs into action.
With the monsters stunned or stuck in place,
Daerik is free to walk in and unleash his
arcane arsenal with brutal effectiveness.
Should he get backed into a corner, he
leans on his abilities to teleport away or
blur himself to regain a strong, aggressive
position while his allies harass the enemies.
