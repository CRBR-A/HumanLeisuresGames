Wrath of the Wild

Members:
- Hamish Burr, The Wildling
- Eonan Machida, The Druid
- Marty Stauffer, The Ranger

Origin story: Isolated Together
It may be strange that living alone in the
wilds is what brought these men together,
but when you're as determined to know every
inch of the forest as they are, it starts to make
sense. Eonan has ensured that they can stay in
touch with each other magically so that when
a serious enough threat to nature's balance
arises, they can convene to stamp it down.

Recent adventure: The Forest Heart
A bugbear shaman rallied his tribe to destroy
the heart of the forest, a large willow tree in its
center. Three weeks of brutal guerilla fighting
finally saw the tribe expelled from the woods
and balance restored.

Tactics: Strike Swiftly, Fade Away
Marty's bear Griz isn't the sneakiest and
Hamish has trouble showing restraint, so
Eonan often takes the form of an owl and
scouts from the air. Once he has enough
information, he unleashes his nearly feral
companions on it.
Knowing what's coming, the forest goes
silent. Then suddenly, a raging bear is lunging
out of the treeline with a rider firing bolts at
anything that moves. The wildling and druid
have their opening and become veritable
forces of nature, hacking and chewing away
at their foes. Then, before the enemy can
organize, they disappear into the forest.
