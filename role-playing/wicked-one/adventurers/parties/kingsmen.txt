The Kingsmen

Members:
- Sir Edvard Lanks, The Knight
- Jeriko Gruval, The Defender
- Marius Prim, The Aristocrat

Origin story: For King and Country
Sir Edvard and Jeriko are sworn to serve
and protect the interests of the kingdom
with their lives. Marius, on the other hand,
puts enough gold in the right purses to help
determine exactly what those interests are. To
that end, he's had Edvard and Jeriko assigned
to accompany him by the king, so wherever
Marius points, they go.

Recent adventure: The First Dent
Some bugbears had set up high above a valley
town, rigging up a cannon to bombard the
village. The Kingsmen sprung into action.
While successful, Jeriko did have to tank a
direct shot, earning the first dent on his shield.

Tactics: Dashed Upon Steel
Jeriko used to insist on being the first into the
fray, though more recently he and Sir Edvard
swap turns taking the lead. Their approach
to dungeon defenses is simple enough. They
know they're not likely to see it coming, so
they just trudge forward and tank trap after
trap, relying on their armor to take the brunt
of the damage.
No matter who goes in first, Marius is always
well behind the pair. He waits for the right
timing and opponent, goading the most
challenging foes into a one on one combat,
which he has trained in his entire life and has
yet to lose.
