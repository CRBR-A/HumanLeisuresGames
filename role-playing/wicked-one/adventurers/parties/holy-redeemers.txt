The Holy Redeemers

Members:
- Hilda Gruul, The Inquisitor
- Petra Peylon, The Cleric
- Guy Vayne, The Occult Slayer

Origin story: Reliquary Requisitions
Throughout his career, Guy would quite often
visit both Hilda and Petra to resupply. When
he found himself finally in need of some help
against a syndicate of powerful demons he
had been tracking, he convinced them to come
along. Once the syndicate was eradicated, they
realized that by working together, they could
do a great deal to bring justice to the world.

Recent adventure: Justice is Blinding
The Holy Redeemers recently chased down a
troublesome band of goblins that had stolen a
relic from the local clergy. As punishment for
their crime, the Redeemers turned the relic's
power on the thieves, blinding them.

Tatics: Careful Eyes
Guy's sense for danger means he usually
takes the lead, watching out for traps or
other hidden threats. Hilda is only ever a
step behind so that she might see through
any tricks or other deceptions that would
lead them away from their quarry. Her flail
punishes anything able to get past his bolts.
Petra stays in the back to ensure that nothing
interrupts his prayers and incantations,
which he uses to protect or empower his
allies. If a monster does get a lucky shot in on
one of them, he can patch them up while the
party takes a quick breather.
