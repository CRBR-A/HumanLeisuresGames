The Wayfaring Disciples

Members:
- Herman Leng, The Monk
- Selena Hammond, The Spellbow 
- Elanor Tara, The Lancer

Origin story: Monger Slayers
Years ago, the kingdom's worst nightmare
came true - a goldmonger had dug itself a
dungeon near the kingdom's border. Wanting
to neutralize the threat before the beast grew,
the crown offered a small fortune to bring
it down. Selena, Elanor, and Herman each
refused the coin, saying that the chance to test
themselves was reward enough.

Recent adventure: Snakes on a Ferry
A local baron called upon the Wayfaring
Disciples to help out with a slither of slissiks
that had taken control of a ferry crossing.
Always up for encoutering new foes, they
jumped at the opportunity.

Tactics: Practiced Unison
Elanor and Herman jump into the fray in
practiced unison. Back to back, one twists
to allow the other to face the enemy with a
flurry. As the enemy's defense is exhausted,
the other comes in to finish the job. Inevitably,
the reach of Elanor's spear and Herman's
insane mobility have enemies struggling to
close in on them.
While the others keep enemies preoccupied,
Selena hangs back from a vantage point,
piercing anything that moves away from the
melee. If they manage to force the enemies
to a further distance, Selena brings out the
heavy hitters in her arsenal.
