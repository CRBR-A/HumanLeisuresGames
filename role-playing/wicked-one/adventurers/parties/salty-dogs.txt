The Salty Dogs

Members:
- Ivanka Blithe, The Buccaneer
- Vance LeTrelle, The Bard
- Roran Aybara, The Weaponsmith

Origin story: A New Blade, A New Ballad
After commandeering a ripe merchant vessel,
Ivanka wanted to commission a new sword
and a ballad to celebrate. Only settling for the
best, she invited Roran and Vance to meet at
a posh tavern. The three became fast friends
while sharing expensive wine, attempting to
one-up each other's tales of past exploits, and
brawling with the other tavern patrons.

Recent adventure: Fodder Cannons
The Salty Dogs ran down an orc pirate ship
fat with booty, cornering it in a cove. Clearly
out of munitions, the orcs fired loads of dead
seagulls at their ship. Beaks still dot the hull,
but the orcs met their end.

Tactics: Dashing and Daring
As much to oblige her as for any strategic
gain, combat usually begins with Ivanka
swinging into action in true pirate form,
throwing caution to the wind. Lending to such
theatrics, Vance strums up an inspirational
tune to light a fire in his allies.
As the swashbuckling surprise fades, it's
Roran's turn to get to work. He cycles through
his personal armory of weapons, grabbing
the perfect tool for the job at hand. He sets
to on their foes with steady effectiveness,
picking up the slack from Ivanka's antics.
Throughout, Vance keeps a watchful eye,
switching up his tune to deal with any threats.
