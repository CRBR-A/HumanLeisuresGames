Magicbane

Members:

Origin story: Goblin Matchmaker
A goblin mage had racked up quite the
bounty attacking trade caravans, drawing
adventurers to the area. Cal showed up for
the riches, Corin to bring peace back to his
land, and Grok was there to get even. Their
combined efforts made easy work of the
goblin and soon they were raising its head on a
pike and discussing their next adventure.

Recent adventure : Molten Hot Rage
A kobold shaman put a city's fate into peril
as she forged a strong magic ritual to ignite a
volcanic eruption. Fortunately for the citizens,
Magicbane arrived just in time to ruin the
ritual and put an end to the shaman.

Tactics : Convenient Distraction
Cal and Grok quickly realized that once Corin
gets going, only exhaustion will stop him. His
savage, mindless aggression is the perfect
thing to draw attention away from them.
Able to stand free of the direct melee after
Corin goes in, they wait for their moment.
Grok keeps his nose in the air, sniffing out
monster magic, while Cal is content to stay
concealed until treasure or an exposed
opponent catches his eye. But with Magicbane,
one thing always holds true - once Grok
identifies a mage, they all drop everything
and converge on that poor bastard.
