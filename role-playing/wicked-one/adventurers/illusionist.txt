The Illusionist

After years of arcane study, the illusionist was
eager to show off her talent in the field. Since that
first foray, she has found as much reward from
the excitement as the coin. By manipulating her
enemy's perception, she renders them useless as
they start to question reality itself.

The illusionist is HELPFUL, but INDECISIVE.
She seeks THRILLS on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Reacts to attacks and surprise with illusions.

OFFENSIVE MOVES:
- nightmarish creature
- show greatest desire
- wild goose chase
DEFENSIVE MOVES:
- illusory wall
- invisibility
- dancing duplicates

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find her to
be carrying a wand of false walls, magic tomes, a
thought-stealing brooch, a cloak of horrific visage, a
notebook full of sketches and ideas for illusions, or a
map to a location where magic is amplified.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, she might spill her guts about a
famous land feature that is actually an illusion
or secrets about another powerful mage.
