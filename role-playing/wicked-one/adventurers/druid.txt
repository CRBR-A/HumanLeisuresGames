The Druid

Monsters wreak havoc wherever they go and it's
no different when they hole up in the wilderness.
Thankfully, the keen eyes of the local fauna alert
the druid to their plight. You can imagine that the
helpless orcs, entangled in vines, are quite surprised
to see a bear-sized badger suddenly appear.

The druid is HONEST, but IMPATIENT.
He seeks VENGEANCE on adventures.

Can shapeshift into any animal.

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find him to be
carrying a cowl of feathers, an iron-wood club, a vial
of blinding sap, retching berries, thick grubs, a seed
pouch, panacea petals, a pair of broken glasses, or a
phoenix feather.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about a
cavern that leads under town, a reverse waterfall,
or a guardian spirit animal.
