The Alchemist

The alchemist dropped out of medical school - not
because of a lack of ability, but because she found
her true calling in melting, blinding, wilting, and
immobilizing monsters with her concoctions.
Thanks to her quick thinking and quicker mixing,
she has a draught for every situation.

The alchemist is CLEVER, but IMPATIENT.
She seeks THRILLS on adventures.

POSSIBLE LOOT
Depending on your luck, you might find her to be
carrying a vile of acid, a well-stocked components
satchel, a corrosion-proof apron, safety goggles,
slipless shoes, a vapor mask, a flask of mercury, or
sure-grip gloves.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, she might spill her guts about a
noble's ailment, a cache of dangerous chemicals,
or the plans to a secret weapon.
