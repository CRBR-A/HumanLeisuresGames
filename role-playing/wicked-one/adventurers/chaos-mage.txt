The Chaos Mage

Unsurprisingly, the chaos mage's abilities are
unpredictable and nearly impossible to control.
Chased out of several towns for accidentally
summoning creatures of the abyss, he keeps to the
wilds where he can't harm anyone. Stumbling upon
a monster pack is the one time he can really let loose.

The chaos mage is OPTIMISTIC, but INDECISIVE.
He seeks EXPLORATION on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Casts random magic when attacked.

OFFENSIVE MOVES
- glittering butterflies
- eyes of madness
- unmask thyself

DEFENSIVE MOVES
- chaos rift
- time shift
- horrific protector

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find him to be
carrying a maddening mask, a dimensional knife,
a rift clock, robes of retaliation, a chaos bangle, a
scroll of phantom cage, a portal primer, or a cracked
mirror showing the wrong reflection.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about a
planar rift deep in the forest, a reverse waterfall,
or a creature not of this world.
