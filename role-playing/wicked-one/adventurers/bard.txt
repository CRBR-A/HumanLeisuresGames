The Bard

With melody and wit as weapons, the bard can both
amplify allies and deafen doers of evil. No slouch if
backed into a corner himself, he's been known to use
monster heads to practice percussion. In addition to
the loot from dungeon delving, his purse swells from
filling taverns with songs of his exploits.

The bard is HELPFUL, but GREEDY.
He seeks RICHES on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Makes all nearby allies perform better.

OFFENSIVE MOVES:
- deafening strum
- musical commands
- dancing tune

DEFENSIVE MOVES:
- distracting song
- helpful words
- melodic lies

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find him to be
carrying an amplifying ascot, a returning dagger,
a harmonic shortsword, a two-step tunic, a hat of
effective fibs, an unfinished composition, or a lute
with several goblin teeth rattling around inside.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about a
ritual chant, a noble's weakness, or a guard's
childhood lullaby.
