The Death Knight

It's not only monsters that make use of darker
magics. When paired with the martial prowess of a
sired knight, the result terrifies good and evil alike.
Little is known about the death knight except that
his childhood was rife with loss at the hands of
monsters. Now, his scythe rarely stops swinging.

The death knight is PERSISTENT, but COCKY.
He seeks VENGEANCE on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Heals when death occurs nearby.

OFFENSIVE MOVES:
- sense death
- speak to dead
- reaping strike

DEFENSIVE MOVES:
- shadow form
- accept fate
- face of death

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find him to be
carrying a leering cowl, a spiked pauldron, plate
mail of the departed, an orb of death detection, a
culling scythe, shadowstride boots, a shallow-grave
sash, or a charcoal rubbing of a tombstone.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about
a sacred graveyard, a ritual of undeath, or the
location of the soul prison.
