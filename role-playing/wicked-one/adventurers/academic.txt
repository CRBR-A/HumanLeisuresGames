The Academic

A poorly designed dungeon can often be bested
by simply memorizing every turn, something the
academic loves nothing more than to do as he delves
in search of treasure. He has also studied everything
from demons to doomseekers to truly know his
enemy. This has also proven to be quite lucrative.

The academic is CLEVER, but GREEDY.
He seeks EXPLORATION on adventures.

PASSIVE : 
Excels at navigating dungeon paths.

OFFENSIVE MOVES :
- monster knowledge
- x-ray monocle
- summoning scroll

DEFENSIVE MOVES :
- teleportation scroll
- outthink a trick
- pose a riddle

POSSIBLE LOOT
Depending on your luck, you might find him to
be carrying a detailed map to a hidden treasure, a
magic scroll, a magnifying glass, an artisan toolkit,
rare materials, a Light Tongue to Dark Tongue
dictionary, or an enchanted monocle.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about how to
improve your dungeon traps, a source of powerful
reagents, or a dark faction's biggest weakness.
