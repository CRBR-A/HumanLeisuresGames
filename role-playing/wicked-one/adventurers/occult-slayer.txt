The Occult Slayer

The occult slayer is a member of a small, elite sect of
priests whose faiths have been honed into a weapon
against that which goes bump in the night. Their
esoteric monster knowledge, god-given sense for
danger, and knack for always having the right gear
help the occult slayers make the night safe again.

The occult slayer is PERSISTENT, but DISHONEST.
He seeks JUSTICE on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Has a sixth sense for danger.

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find him to be
carrying a nightsight fedora, a pure silver emblem,
an armless crossbow, holy water, a smudge stick, a
sanctified trench coat, hallowing boots, or a child's
drawing of a demon.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about his
church's secret weapon, plans against a monster
faction, or a newly arrived demonic cult.
