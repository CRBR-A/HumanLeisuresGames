The Amazon

A force of nature, the amazon is as powerful as she
is beautiful. With the flash of a smile or glint of
steel, she has tested her will against all manner of
monsters and cleared innumerable dungeons. In the
rare event she finds herself in trouble, beasts of the
land have been known to come to her aid.

The amazon is HONEST, but STUBBORN.
She seeks CHALLENGE on adventures.

PASSIVE :
Has a very strong mind and willpower.

OFFENSIVE MOVES :
- charming smile
- kick down a door
- cleave in half

POSSIBLE LOOT
Depending on your luck, you might find her to
be carrying a well-crafted sword, rare herbs, a
mind-bolstering bone necklace, a gourd full of
strong alcohol, a ceremonial comb, a runic tablet, or
a sash of wilderness comfort.

LAST WORDS:
The amazon's mastery of her will transcends
her physical body. She will not reveal useful
information, however cruel the torture.
