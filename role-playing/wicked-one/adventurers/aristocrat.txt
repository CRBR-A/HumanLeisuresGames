The Aristocrat

A paragon of high society, the aristocrat spends
much of his time at elegant affairs and plotting his
next political maneuvers. When he cannot solve a
problem with his purse and must get his hands dirty,
he does so with the masterful flick of his rapier and
his sharpest weapon, his tongue.

The aristocrat is CONFIDENT, but BRASH.
He seeks RESPECT on adventures.

watch, or a party invitation.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about royal
secrets, hidden city entrances, or a valuable goods
shipment.
