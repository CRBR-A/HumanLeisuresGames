### Evocation : Summon Hellish Fiends

The hells are full of demons, devils, and fiends waiting to be pulled forth from their firey domain and put to good use. You open portals and pull through whatever servants you need, binding them to do your bidding.

When evocation spells fail, the fiend you summoned might take vengeance on you for disturbing them, break free and run amok, or hold a grudge against you.

**Limitations**: Evocation requires the actual summoning and binding of creatures from hell, which generally don't take too kindly to this. You might also leave lingering portals or need to make small offerings to appease them.
