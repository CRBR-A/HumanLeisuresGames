### Pyromancy : Watch the World Burn

Fire is the ultimate destructive force. It's wild, fickle, and blazing hot. But within that chaos, there is a beauty that captivates your attention. It's a cleansing force that those who wield can unleash upon the world.

When pyromancy spells fail, you might light up your allies instead, catch something unintended on fire, or burn up a piece of your own gear.

**Limitations**: Pyromancy requires what you're targeting to be burnable and struggles against anything resistant to fire. You might also be unable to cast in rain or need to directly shoot flames from a body part like your mouth.
