### Enchantment: Manipulate Weak Minds

You delve deep into the minds of others, eliciting emotion and controlling thoughts. You can alter memories, implant the seeds of action, or give explicit commands which you expect to be followed. The weaker the mind, the stronger your magic is.

When enchantment spells fail, you might falsely believe it worked, the target may become aware of what you were attempting, or the spell might be reflected back at you.

**Limitations**: Enchantment only works against living creatures and tends to work better on those with lesser intelligence. You might also have to share a language or only be able to elicit a certain range of thoughts and emotions.
