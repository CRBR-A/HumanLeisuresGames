### Necromancy : The Cold Caress of Unlife

Flesh and bone have memory of life and, even once the spark is gone, that memory can be forced to serve your will. You can fill these vessels with necrotic energy to bring forth unlife or turn that necrotic energy against living flesh, sapping its strength.

When necromancy spells fail, the ghosts of those you're raising might hinder you, a skeleton may break free of your command, or the memories of your victims could haunt you.

**Limitations**: Necromancy requires flesh or bone and tends to work far better on the already dead. You might also need to lay your hands on the target or place your own soul within a vessel.
