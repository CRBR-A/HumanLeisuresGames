### Illusion : Confuse the Senses

Not all is as it seems, a fact you know better than anyone. The eyes can be tricked quite easily, though the nose and ears may be a little tougher. As one begins to lose trust in their senses, they may even begin to question their own reality.

When illusion spells fail, they might depict the wrong scene, briefly manifest into reality, or confuse you into believing they're working even though they're not.

**Limitations**: Illusion requires that you've previously seen or experienced what you're conjuring. You might also only be able to affect one sense or be unable to control who is affected by your spells.
