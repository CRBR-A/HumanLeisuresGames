### Force Mastery : Move Objects at Will

There is a force flowing throughout this world, intertwining all objects. You can sense and manipulate this tension to propel non-living matter as you please. Living matter, on the other hand, defies this force and is beyond your ability.

When force mastery spells fail, you might drop whatever you were moving on an ally, break it apart instead of picking it up, or move it way beyond where you intended.

**Limitations**: Force mastery can only move objects, not things that are alive such as plants and animals. You might also only be able to move one type of material, like stone, or lose one of your senses while casting.
