### Soothsaying : The Timeless Eye

You can cast your sight far and wide, moving your senses forwards and backwards through time. You play with alternative versions of the future and delve into events in the past, looking to unlock valuable secrets.

When soothsaying spells fail, you might get bad information, curse yourself by toying with future timelines, or make the one who you were viewing aware of your presence.

**Limitations**: Soothsaying only sees a possible version of the future and a likely version of the past, being prone to error and misinterpretation. You might also only be able to see through a certain element or require a related item.
