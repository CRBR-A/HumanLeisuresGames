### Wildheart : The Brutality of Nature

The power of nature is immense, but you hold sway over it. The dark beasts and creepy crawlers of the world obey your commands. Gnarled roots and thorny vines move when you beckon. Even the cold soil and rushing waters answer your calls.

When wildheart spells fail, you might lose nature's trust for a while, slip into a temporary feral state, or nature might cause unintended trouble.

**Limitations**: Wildheart requires plants, animals, or aspects of nature to interact with. You might also only able to cast while on solid ground or limit yourself to one style such as casting plant magic with seeds.
