## Witchcraft

You call upon or compel natural and ancestral spirits to assist you with your evildoings. Witchcraft is the purview of Shamans, who can learn to cast higher level spells within this magic discipline. Wielders of witchcraft draw their power from nature or the spirit world. You might have been raised by wolves and taught their secrets, possessed by a spirit who now is your companion, or been hit by lightning, which released your ability to command it.

Over the following pages, the witchcraft magic paths are laid out with example spells, failures, limitations, and magical focuses. Remember that spell tiers fluctuate depending not on the spell effect itself, but on what you're trying to accomplish with it. All of these are merely examples to help show what might be possible within that path. Magic is a creative endeavor and up to you to define the power you wield.

**Witchcraft has the following magic paths:**

- **Bloodreading**: The Pulse of Life
- **Soothsaying**: The Timeless Eye
- **Stormstrike**: The Storm's Fury
- **Spiritcalling**: The World Beyond
- **Wildheart**: The Brutality of Nature
