### Stormstrike : The Storm's Fury

The storm is the ultimate power of nature, wreaking havoc and destruction without reserve. You understand the ebbs and flows of the storm, harnessing it for your own purposes. You control clouds, wind, rain, hail, and lightning.

When stormstrike spells fail, you might cause favorable weather conditions for your enemies, strike your allies, or lose control of the raging storm.

**Limitations**: Stormstrike requires access to the open sky or flowing winds. You might also have your magic affected by the current weather conditions or need to recharge yourself occasionally by being struck by lightning.
