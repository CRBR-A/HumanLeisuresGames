### Bloodreading : The Pulse of Life

Bodies are nothing more than the blood coursing through their veins, and you know blood well. You can sense it, read it, control it, and use it to push people past their limits, seal wounds closed, or force its body to do terrible things.

When bloodreading spells fail, you might invigorate your target, send them into a blood-boiling rage, or harm yourself instead.

**Limitations**: Bloodreading requires a living target. You might also need to make them bleed first or touch their flesh with your own before you can cast spells on them.
