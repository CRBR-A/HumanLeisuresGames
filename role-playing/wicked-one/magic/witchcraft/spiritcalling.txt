### Spiritcalling : The World Beyond

The spirits of the dead linger, waiting to take care of unfinished business. They have their own motivations, but when you talk, they listen. They're a good source of information, but only know what they've seen.

When spiritcalling spells fail, you might attract unwanted attention from dangerous spirits, scare friendly spirits away, or slip into the spirit realm yourself.

**Limitations**: Spiritcalling requires there to be the lingering spirits of the dead, and the more recent the better. You might also only be able to see animal spirits or have to broker deals with them for their help.
