### Vahoona, The Howler at Night

**Goddess of Nightmares and Twilight**. She dwells in darkness, slips into dreams, and feeds off of fear and paranoia. She is the terror lurking deep in everyone's heart.

Vahoona may forsake you if you displease her, such as by failing to bring terror into the world, ending someone's fear too quickly, or fearing something more than her.
