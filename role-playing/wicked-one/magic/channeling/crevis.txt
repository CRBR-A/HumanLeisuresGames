**God of Cowardice and Suffering**. He is intensely focused on self-preservation. Others suffering or fleeing are the only things that distract from his self-loathing.

Crevis may forsake you if you displease him, such as by facing an enemy head on, putting yourself on the line, or getting caught in a terrible situation.
