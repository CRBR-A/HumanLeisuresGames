### Iziza, The Sweet Mistress

**Goddess of Seduction and Trickery**. She is all sweet words and lies. She wormed her way into Gorlag's good graces, got her tentacles around him, and never let go.

Iziza may forsake you if you displease her, such as by missing a chance to exploit someone, being used for others' purpose, or telling the truth with nothing to gain.
