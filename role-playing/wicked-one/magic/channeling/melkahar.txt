### Melkahar, The Rotting Prince

**God of Pestilence and Decay**. He is the rotten soul of the eternal empire. For aeons, it expanded ever further outwards, leaving the core to rot away.

Melkahar may forsake you if you displease him, such as by bringing order where decay reigns, maintaining long relationships, or missing a chance to defile beauty.
