### Talazar, The Relentless Stalker

**God of Vengeance and the Hunt**. He is the apex predator, never giving up once on a trail. His pride prevents him from letting even the smallest slight go unanswered.

Talazar may forsake you if you displease him, such as by giving up on your quarry, being hunted down yourself, or passing on the chance at vengeance.
