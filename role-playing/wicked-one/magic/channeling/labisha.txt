**Goddess of Slaughter and Savagery**. She kills for the joy of killing and feasts on the bodies of her enemies. To deny others their chance at life is to truly live.

Labisha may forsake you if you displease her, such as by running from a fight, passing on the chance for a good meal, or partaking in civilized endeavors.
