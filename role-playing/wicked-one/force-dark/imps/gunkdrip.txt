Gunkdrip

Quite ironically, Gunkdrip is one of the most hygienic
imps around. Unfortunately for him, and anyone down
wind, his job keeps him in a constant state of dripping
various kinds of noxious sputum. On the rare occasion
he gets to clean up, he is still a pariah as the other imps
don't even recognize him.

DUNGEON ROLE
Gunkdrip is responsible for keeping the dungeon's
creatures vile and voracious. Between waste removal,
releasing the goldmonger's impacted femoral pores,
and feedings without being fed upon, it's a big, dirty job.
Fortunately for him, even the most horrid of creatures
don't like snacks covered in their own snot.

DURING INVASIONS
Should adventurers come knocking, there
is little Gunkdrip himself can do beyond
the average imp. Fortunately, the
creatures he works with trust him
enough to lead them to their next
meal. He watches carefully as the
heroes are eaten to see if there is
anything of value he can dig out
when they come out the other end.
