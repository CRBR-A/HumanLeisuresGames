Blamf

In a series of events no one fully understands, Blamf
crawled from the spawning pit into the blink dog den.
Years passed before anyone noticed but by then, he
was totally convinced he was a blink dog. Strangest of
all is that Blamf actually gained the ability to teleport
short distances. It's likely a result of all the suckling.

DUNGEON ROLE
It took quite some time just to convince Blamf that
he is actually an imp. Now that he's bipedal again,
Blamf serves as the dungeon's messenger, blinking
important information from room to room. He's till
working on breaking his habit of sniffing the tails of
the imps he reports to.

DURING INVASIONS
When adventurers come sniffing around,
it's Blamf's job to blink around and
make sure everyone is on high
alert. Once he's spread the
word, he rejoins his old blink
dog pack to let the beast out
for old times sake and sink
his teeth into some heroes.
