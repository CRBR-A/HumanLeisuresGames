Jockjamz Jockjamz

There are really only two things that can whip imps
into a unified frenzy. The first is when the bosses come
back from a successful raid loaded with good loot. The
second, and only slightly less effective, is Jockjamz.
There is some indescribable quality to the way he can
stomp, stomp, clap his way into the hearts of his kin to
ignite their true passion.

DUNGEON ROLE
Every dungeon has morale problems occasionally.
Especially after some calamity wipes out dozens of
imps. This is when Jockjamz does his thing and gets
everyone's feet stomping again. When imps are part
of a collective noise making, they easily forget that 13
of them just got blown up in the warlock's experiment.

DURING INVASIONS
Picture the heroes slowly, cautiously
entering the dungeon - the boom, boom,
clap barely audible. They clear two rooms,
but now the boom booms reverberate up
their legs, rattling their armor. They press
on, fighting imp after imp incensed by the
unending rhythm. The boom, boom, clap
grows ever louder.
