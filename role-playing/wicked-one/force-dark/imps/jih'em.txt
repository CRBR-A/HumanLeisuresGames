Jih'em

Jih'em runs a game of Humans and Households every
week that's gotten pretty popular. He has five players
that are always on time and always bring snacks. It's
exhausting. They are always offering to take over as
household master, too, but that's his job. He always
has hours of pure combat planned, but his lore-hobo
players just want to deep dive into human politics.

DUNGEON ROLE
Jih'em has been ignoring his actual responsibilities
for so long that he's not sure what they are anymore.
Whatever they were, they would likely interfere with
planning his next H&H session, which just wouldn't do
at all.

DURING INVASIONS
There's nothing worse than having
to stop killing humans to deal with a
dungeon invasion. Jih'em just tosses
all of his four-sided dice in front of
the room they play in as a deterrent.
If they still come in, he has tons of
unpainted minis to use as ammo.
