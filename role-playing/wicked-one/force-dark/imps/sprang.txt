Sprang

Sprang has a strong tendency to meander the dungeon
while off in his own little world. This likely explains why
he is constantly stepping into the dungeon's defenses.
It happens so frequently that the other imps think he
does it on purpose for attention. Last time he dropped
into the pit trap, they left him in there for 9 days.

DUNGEON ROLE
After his near-death in the pit trap, everyone realizes
Sprang doesn't do this for pity. Cleverly, the bosses
decided to make the most of his bumbling and gave
him a checklist of all the traps in the dungeon. Sprang's
new job is simply to cross every trap he triggers off the
list, indicating it still works.

DURING INVASIONS
When ne'erdobad adventurers come to
pick a fight, Sprang sees an opportunity
to put his absentminded talent to use.
He finds a hiding spot from which he
can see his favorite trap. When the
heroes come through, he does his
best to push them into it - even if it
means going in himself.
