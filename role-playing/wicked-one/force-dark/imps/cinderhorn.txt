Cinderhorn

It's a momentous occasion for any imp when one of
the bosses recruits their “help” with an experiment.
Cinderhorn, then just Horn, got such an honor and
helped with “testing” some new fire enchantments.
Better yet, the experiment was a complete success! His
horns are on fire but won't burn up, though they didn't
seem to care that Cinderhorn can still feel the flames.

DUNGEON ROLE
Quite problematically, he's always been in charge of the
explosives storeroom. While truly wanting a new job,
questioning the bosses' wisdom is rarely a good idea.
So to keep himself and the dungeon in one piece, he
learned to do his job with a 10-foot pole in each hand.

DURING INVASIONS
Every imp knows to aim their horns
for the fleshy bumps a hero has
below where their tails should be.
With his “gift,” that strategy is even
more effective! And should they
come knocking at his store room, he
always has the option to send them off
with a bang.
