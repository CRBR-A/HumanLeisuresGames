Peesee

Despite being new to Households and Humans, Peesee
has the rulebook memorized. What kind of imp would
slow down everyone else's experience to constantly
refer to the rulebook? Peesee also understands that
there are some rules that are not used very often, so
the HM just makes up something logical. Not even
an imp would bring the whole game to a halt to look
up the actual rule, which is less fun anyway. Peesee
understands that HMing is hard, which is why he puts
up with nonstop combat when he really just wants to
know the character's feelings and motivations.

DUNGEON ROLE
Peesee is supposed to be in charge of games and
recreation, whatever that means. He just encourages his
imp friends to come and try Households and Humans.

DURING INVASIONS
Peesee deals with enough combat in their
H&H game. He doesn't need real humans
to interrupt what little lore they get
too. He'll stab anyone that barges in
with one of his perfectly sharpened
pencils, which he never forgets.
