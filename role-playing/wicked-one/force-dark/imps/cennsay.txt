Cennsay

Imps have a reputation for being unscrupulous,
opportunistic cowards but Cennsay is living proof
that with self control and determination, you can
sometimes omit the cowardly part. Based on the tenets
of honor and discipline, he has put together a system
of imp martial arts featuring more than twenty ways to
bite your opponent's genitals.

DUNGEON ROLE
In truth, the bosses tasked Cennsay with training
groups of the more disposable imps so they don't have
to arm them all. If one of his students can manage to
not get mowed down and somehow slow the dungeon's
enemies, they will have far exceeded expectations.

DURING INVASIONS
The time for training is over once heroes set
foot in the dungeon. As a paragon of respect
and wisdom, Cennsay lets his students
enter the fray first. Depending on how
immediately they are slain, it is
likely wiser for him to retreat so
that he can live to train the next
group.
