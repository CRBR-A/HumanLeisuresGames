**Creatures** are mindless or unintelligent monsters or beasts that have chosen to lair in your dungeon. Theyâ€™re not under your direct control, though they fight off invaders in defense of their lairs. A crafty Wicked One or minion might be able to trick or goad them into doing something for them, though. They're neutral towards other dungeon denizens for the most part, though a bad calamity roll might bring them into conflict with each other. Monsters moving past or through their lairs generally go unimpeded.

Creatures are rated from tier 1 to tier 4, representing how deadly they are. A creature might be a single monster or it could be a group of smaller monsters. When an invader passes by the entrance to their lair or moves through it, the creature engages them and defends its home.

When adventurers pass near a lair's entrance, they're drawn inside. It doesn't matter if they were just moving by the entrance or were going straight through the lair. When adventurers are in the vicinity of a creature, it will seek to defend its lair. **You roll a creature's tier to determine how a fight goes.** Before making the roll, narrate how the creatures move to engage the adventurers.
