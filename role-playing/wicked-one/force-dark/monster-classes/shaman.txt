## Shaman

> Terrifying & Vengeful Witches

You understand the dark power of nature and are drawn to the hidden world of spirits. You might revere them and seek their favor, or perhaps enslave them for your own purposes. Either way, the spirits speak and you hear their mad whispers of vengeance. You begin play with the following **core ability**:

Witchcraft: You have mastered a magic path (choose one): *bloodreading* - *soothsaying* - *spiritcalling* - *stormstrike* - *wildheart*. You can spend stress to ***Invoke*** tier 2 and tier 3 spells of your path.

things a Shaman would have thought to do : *interacting with spirits or animals*, *brewing a wild concoction*, or *sowing terror*.

You can spend stress to assume the form of a beast. While in this form, one of your actions swaps ratings with another and you gain either ***Primal Ability*** or a special ability from another calling. You also gain a second dark impulse while in this form. All of these are chosen when you first take this ability.

#### Bonded Spirit

You have a magically bonded spirit or pack instead of minions. It has the companion upgrade and powers (choose two): *become invisible* - *manifest physically* - *possess the weak-minded* - *reveal information about the past*. It can use each once per cycle.
