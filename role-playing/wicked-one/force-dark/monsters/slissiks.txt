> ### Slissiks
> **Slissiks** are snake-like creatures that tend to react defensively to surprise and feel the need to always keep an eye on those around them. They have terrible memories, which leads to exaggerating details in stories to fill in gaps. A slissik might say:
> > "Where ya goin'? How long are you gonna be there?"  
> > "Woah, don’t sneak up on me like that!"  
> > "There were… 4, 5..., no, wait, 6 of them!"
