> ### Kobolds
> **Kobolds** are small, raucous creatures. They look like a mix between a rodent, a dog, and a lizard. Theyâ€™re hyperactive and aggressive, with short attention spans. They usually prefer working together on something. They rarely have a sense of self preservation. A kobold might say:
> > "What the hell was I doing again? Oh yeah, stabbin'!"  
> > "Oh, that's shiny! I think I'll be having that."  
> > "Kill 'em all before they get away!"
