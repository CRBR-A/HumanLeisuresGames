> ### Demons
> **Demons** are minor hellspawn that have somehow found their way into the mortal world. They tend to enjoy chaos, especially lies which they think mortals react to in ridiculous ways. Being immortal, death is only a return to their home. A demon might say:
> > "I tire of this world of mortals."  
> > "It's just death. It's not like it's my first time."  
> > "Why tell the truth when lyin's more fun?"
