# Bugbears
Bugbears are huge, bullish creatures, prone to rage and not exactly known for their intellect. They tend to see themselves as natural leaders and think they should be in charge. They like to follow others into a dangerous fight. They’re unlikely to stick their neck out for anyone. 

A bugbear might say: 
"Listen, there’s no way I’m dyin’ first. Get in there."  
"My mind’s made up. In we go."  
"Who the hell are you to give me orders?"
