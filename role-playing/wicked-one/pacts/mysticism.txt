Boon: During a downtime, you can make a sacrifice to
your deity, paying cost to gain a boon (choose one): take +1d
on a single roll with an item this cycle - take +1d on your next
resistance roll - your next failure instead becomes a mixed. The
sacrifice must be unique each time you ask for a boon.

Intervention: Once per cycle, one member of the pact
can beseech the pact’s deity to cast a tier 3 spell from their
domains. You roll the dungeon tier as an action roll with
no dice penalty and the GM determines who is open to any
consequences.

Farseeing: Once during a long downtime, the pact gains
glimpses of the activity of factions in the world. You can
establish a fact about a faction or make a 3d roll to tick one of
their clocks forward or backward

Visions: You can establish a fact in the present about an
NPC’s next likely action, but you immediately take shock of the
GM’s choice. A fortune roll determines how the NPC’s action
plays out. What form does the vision take?
