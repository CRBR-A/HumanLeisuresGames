Agents of Chaos: You excel at placing blame on others or
interfering with faction plans. On a success on blowback, your
hirelings gain morale and you can finish or reset a faction
clock. How did you redirect the blame to cause this?

Cunning Plans: A well-laid out plan has contingencies.
You take +1d on engagement rolls for negotiation, stealth, or
trickery plans. On a success during a flashback during such a
plan, you gain a dark heart.

Oral Traditions: You commonly share the oral traditions
of your people with each other and others you meet. Once
during a long downtime, the pact can establish a fact about
the history, cultures, or arcana of the world. You can also
flashback to use this. What story was told to you and by whom?

Winged Scouts: You are accompanied by bats, ravens, or
other small winged beasts at your service. Each time you
choose a plan, the pact can establish a fact about the target
that your beasts saw from the sky. You can also flashback to
use this again once during the plan.
