The pact replaces the dungeon. 
Each group of monsters has a reason to be travelling together - choose a pact motivation and link it to factions within the sandbox you've chosen, then build your characters as normal with this in mind.

Pact abilities replace dungeon rooms. 
These are split into four categories for ease of reference - Battle, Meddling, Mysticism, and Utility. The pact chooses one ability when you begin play and you gain a new one each time a story arc culminates.
