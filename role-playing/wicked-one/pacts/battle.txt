Loyalty: You instill great respect in your hirelings. They have
the mindset (loyal) upgrade. If you take harm that would leave
you bloodied, they will take the hit in your stead - bloodying
or killing them.

Mounts: You have mounts to carry you into battle, enough
for your entire group, including hirelings. You always manage
to replace lost ones during long downtimes. Detail them and
give them edges (choose two): aquatic - armored - enormous -
fast - flying - magical - powerful - terrifying.

Strategic Plans: Proper strategy is the key to warfare. You
take +1d on engagement rolls for ambush, assault, or strike
raid plans. On a success, you gain a dark heart.

Warrior Culture: When hirelings witness any pact
member die in glorious combat, they gain morale and lose
the bloodied condition if they have it. However, they are now
compelled to finish what their allies started.
