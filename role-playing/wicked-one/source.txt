      Instead, Wicked Ones has been set to CC0, meaning it's now in the 
      public domain. It can be freely used, distributed, or even re-sold as 
      you like. The updated wording should be on the updated Wicked Ones v1.4
      and Toolkit deck files you can download from your DTRPG library.
      The artwork and any associated files are also released into CC0.
