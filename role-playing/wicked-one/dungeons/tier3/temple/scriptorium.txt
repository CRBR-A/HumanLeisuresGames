#### Scriptorium

Your deeds are recorded in unholy scripture, immediately giving you wicked xp equal to your dungeon tier. You also gain a new wicked xp trigger: Were your actions worthy of your godâ€™s notice? Each PC must prove their own worth to gain this xp.

*A scriptorium might need desks, writing equipment, or leather for binding.*
