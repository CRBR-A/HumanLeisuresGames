#### Penance Chamber

Your minions fear punishment more than death and will never betray you. When they fight to the death, they ignore the dice penalty from being bloodied.

*A penance chamber might need shackles, whips, or tar.*

"Grabbing the dagger off of her dead friend with the only hand she has left, the cultist staggers to her feet and mutters, 'Death in service.'"
