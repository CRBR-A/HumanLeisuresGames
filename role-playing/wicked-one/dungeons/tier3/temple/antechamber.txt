#### Antechamber

Between the stairway and sanctum on the final level is an impressive room glorifying your deeds in the name of your dark god. Adventurers stop to take note of it, giving you a dark heart and +1d on the engagement roll before a sanctum fight.

*An antechamber might need skulls, the banners of worthy foes, or an artist.*

"The adventurers creep through the antechamber, horrified by the scenes depicted on its frescoed walls. You can hear their gasps, filling your dark hearts with glee as you prepare for battle."
