#### Altar

You can make a sacrifice at the altar, paying cost to gain a dark blessing (choose one): *take +1d on a single roll with an item this cycle* - *take +1d on your next resistance roll* - *your next failure instead becomes a mixed*. The sacrifice must be unique each time you ask for a blessing.

*An altar might need incense, statues, or icons specific to your god's domains.*
