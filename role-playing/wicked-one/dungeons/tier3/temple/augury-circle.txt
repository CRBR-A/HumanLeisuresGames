#### Augury Circle

You can flashback to time spent in the circle, reading portents of future events. You can establish a fact in the present about an NPC's next likely action. *What portent did the circle show you and how does it manifest in the present?*

*An augury circle might need mosaic tiles, a large mirror, or exotic incenses.*

> "Chaotic imagery fills my vision, then Zaheen shows me a portent - a sparrow flying through the madness. In the present, the same sparrow smacks straight into the door and dies, warning me of a guard ambush."
