#### Reliquary

This room corrupts and amplifies the magic of up to three items of unholy impact placed within it. When an item is placed, it immediately incants a tier 2 ritual causing a persistent effect within your dungeon related to the specific item.

*A reliquary does not require special materials beyond the items placed within it.*

"I put the holy ring, still on the priest's finger, on the pedestal. The reliquary twists the domains of the fishing village's goddess, filling our underground river with carnivorous fish. It's now an extreme hazard."
