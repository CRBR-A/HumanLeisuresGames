#### Dormitory

Fresh cultists flock to serve your god. You can recruit minions from this room. They always have your god's favored action, chosen when this room is built, as their primary action and start with the *mindset (zealous)* upgrade for free. This room also acts as a creature with a tier equal to the dungeon tier.

*A dormitory might need furniture, accoutrements, or the first batch of pupils.*

"It seems like a new clan of scrawny kobolds has felt the pull of Gimosha. I toss a goldâ€™s worth of obsidian daggers on the floor and say, 'Anyone that comes away with a dagger is promoted.'"
