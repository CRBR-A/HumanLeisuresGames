#### Library

Books are the key to knowledge of the world. Once per cycle, the dungeon can establish a fact about the history, cultures, or arcana of the world. You can also flashback to use this again while outside the dungeon.

*A library might need a trove of books, large bookshelves, or a librarian.*
