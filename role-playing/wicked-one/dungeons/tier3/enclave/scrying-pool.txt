#### Scrying Pool
The pool reveals far away scenes. Once per cycle, the dungeon can establish a fact about an NPCâ€™s recent activity. You can also flashback to use this again while outside the dungeon. *What question or object do you present to the pool to guide its gaze?*

*A scrying pool might need cursed water, mosaic tiles, or a center figurine.*
