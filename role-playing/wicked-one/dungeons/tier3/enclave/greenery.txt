#### Greenery

This garden of voracious plants will devour living prey. Feed them to harvest (choose one): *a plant-based shared supply* - *special ingredients for potions*, *a few doses of a concoction*. The higher the tier, the better the harvest. This room is also a trap equal to your dungeon tier.

*A greenery might need rare plants, fertilizer, or artificial sunlight.*
