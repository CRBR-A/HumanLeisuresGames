#### Spawning Chamber

Minions are grown or summoned here, easily replacing your losses. Once per dungeon defense, a copy of a slain minion pack can burst forth from this spawning chamber. You can also add the *expendable* upgrade to minions for free.

*A spawning chamber might need mystical goo, glass containers, or magic seeds.*
