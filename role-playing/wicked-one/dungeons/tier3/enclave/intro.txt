## Enclave

Tapping Into the Arcane. 
Choose this dungeon theme if you want your dungeon to be mystical from top to bottom. Its core function is ***twisted landscape***, corrupting the area surrounding your dungeon. An Enclave has the following tier 3 rooms: ***academy***, ***crucible***,  **greenery***, ***library***, ***potion lab***, ***scrying pool***, and ***spawning chamber***.

An Enclave is infused with magic. Arcane energy lingers in the air, runes are scrawled on the walls, and even the lowliest of minions may have some level of magical aptitude. You start with this **core function**:

[context]: # (important rule)
> ***Twisted Landscape***: Arcane energy corrupts the area around the dungeon. Establish its range, increasing with tier, and how it manifests (choose 3): *corrupted wildlife* - *dark whispers* - *illusions* - *inclement weather* - *living plants* - *wisps*. These act as a trap and a trick equal to the dungeon tier against invaders.
