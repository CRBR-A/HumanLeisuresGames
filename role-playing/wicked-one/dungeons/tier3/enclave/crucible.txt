#### Crucible

The mystical power of this room enchants items. Each downtime, it can either produce a single tier 1 magic item or tick a magic item creation clock twice. You must still provide the special requirements for tier 2 and 3 magic items.

*A crucible might need an essence core, a mystical beast, or magical helpers.*
