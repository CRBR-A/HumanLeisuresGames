#### Academy

Young monsters come to study and learn arcane secrets. You can recruit minions from this room. They have ***Invoke*** as their primary action and the *adept* upgrade for free. This room also acts as a creature with a tier equal to the dungeon tier.

*An academy might need crystal balls, mantles, or wands.*
