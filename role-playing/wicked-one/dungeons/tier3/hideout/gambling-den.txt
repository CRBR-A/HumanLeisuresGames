#### Gambling Den

You set up a small gambling establishment, attracting monsters from outside your dungeon. You can recruit minions from this room. They always have Trick as their primary action and start with the strapped upgrade for free. This room also acts as a creature with a tier equal to the dungeon tier.

*A gambling den might need gambling tables, luxurious lighting, or cigars.*

working together. I definitely want them on our side."
