#### Gear Locker

You always get geared up before leaving the dungeon. You gain a supply slot and have a steady supply of the following concoctions and gear: *climbing gear* - *glowsticks* - *smoke bombs* - *tar bombs* - *throwing weapons* - *thunderstones* - *traps*.

*A gear locker might need a trove of concoctions, crates of gear, or matching outfits.*
