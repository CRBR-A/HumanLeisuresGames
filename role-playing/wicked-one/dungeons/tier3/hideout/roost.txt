#### Roost

You have bats, ravens, or other small winged beasts at your service. Each time you plan a raid, the dungeon can establish a fact about the target that your beasts saw from the sky. You can also flashback to use this again while outside the dungeon.

*A roost might need cages, winged beasts, or pet food.*
