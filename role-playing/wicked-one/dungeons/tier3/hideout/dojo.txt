#### Dojo

The dojo master trains you relentlessly, forging you into a unified team. When you team up, you only take stress on a failure and 6s from different participants count towards rolling a critical. This room also acts as a creature with a tier equal to the dungeon tier.

*A dojo only needs a master to train you, which you must either defeat or impress.*

"Complete silence greets the monk and she steps lightly into the room.
Her keen eyes catch two imps at the far end scurrying over and sliding
the doors open. The master steps out and says, 'Finally, a real fight.'"
