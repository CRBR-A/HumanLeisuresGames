#### War Drums

A steady beat emanates throughout your dungeon, keeping everyone focused on the task at hand. Each player can tick a project clock once per downtime, but each tick must go to a different clock. Your imps also take +1d on their downtime action.

*War drums might need lots of leather, huge wooden drums, or massive horns.*

"The adventurers steel themselves and head in. They hear the low, deep pounding of drums from deep within the tunnel giving them a shiver up their spine."
