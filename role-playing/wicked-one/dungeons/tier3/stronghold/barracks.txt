#### Barracks

Fresh recruits flock to your dungeon. You can recruit minions from this room. They have ***Smash*** as their primary action and the mindset (loyal) upgrade for free. This room also acts as a creature with a tier equal to the dungeon tier.

*A barracks might need a cache of weapons, armor, or a large amount of rations.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "I ***Smash*** the biggest one in the face. 'Follow me. There's work to do.'"
