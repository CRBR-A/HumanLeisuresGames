#### Smithy

You have a steady supply of mundane weapons such as axes, bows, and hatchets. Your minions take +1d when crafting items or adding edges.

*A smithy might need an anvil, metalworking tools, or a large pile of charcoal.*

> "I head down to the smithy and throw my battleaxe on the table along with a small pile of gold and say, 'Make it look scary as hell.' My minions fight a bit over the gold, then get to work."
