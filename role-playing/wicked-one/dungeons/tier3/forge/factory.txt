#### Factory

Your imps relentlessly sweat away in the factory. Each downtime, they can either produce a single tier 1 contraption or tick a contraption clock twice.

*A factory might need metal casing for a boiler, piles of coal, or raw iron.*

"I wake up heavily hungover, lying on a table. I turn my head to see machinery and tools tossed about, the result of my drunken rampage. The imps are all scowling at me. I guess they can't work this downtime."
