#### Guild Hall

You let your minions organize to better their working and living conditions. In truth, you ignore their demands, but the illusion of having some control reduces grumbling. The dungeon takes +1d on calamity rolls.

*A guild hall might need benches, a long table, or scribing tools.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "Your minions are sitting in the guild hall having a guild meeting. You see one of the kobold alchemists pounding a gavel, calling the meeting to order. Then suddenly, BAM - the door is kicked in by adventurers."
