#### Alchemist Lab

Your imps are always hard at work mixing reagents. You have a steady supply of all tier 1 concoctions.

*An alchemist lab might need alchemy equipment, chests full of reagents, or recipes.*

"KABOOM! An explosion in the lab showers a minion pack with beastlure and broken glowsticks falling off the shelves. From down the hall outside, you hear the sniffing of wargs."
