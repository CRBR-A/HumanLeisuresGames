#### Tier 2 Rooms & Structures

***Guard Post***: Assign a single pack of minions to this room. They can always start dungeon defense here regardless of their <ins>starting position roll</ins>.

***Minion Lair***: Assign a single pack of minions to this room. These minions get morale each recovery and take +1d when defending the room against invaders. Give it two atmospheric traits from the minor room list.

***Prison***: A room with 4 cells that can contain prisoners, who can't escape without *opportunity*. If invaders enter the prison, make a fortune roll equal to the dungeon tier to determine whether prisoners can be freed and if they join the invaders.

***Stairway***: Add another level to your dungeon, with the sanctum remaining at the bottom. This stairway connects them.

***Torture Chamber***: You gain +position or +effect (your choice) when <ins>torturing</ins>.
