The Cleric

If faith could buy rations, the cleric would never go
hungry. Sadly, it doesn't, so he keeps his ear to the
ground for evil wrongdoings that he can rectify and
lives off of the loot and rewards. His actions tend to
be dictated by the deity he follows, also making him
a slippery opponent with help just a prayer away.

The cleric is GENEROUS, but STUBBORN.
He seeks JUSTICE on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Heals an ally a bit when they take a break.

OFFENSIVE MOVES:
- prayer of restoration
- prayer of retribution
- prayer of divine power

DEFENSIVE MOVES:
- prayer of guidance
- prayer of shielding
- prayer of sanctuary

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find him to be
carrying a bottomless canteen, a penitent crook,
worn prayer beads, a religious artifact, the scripture,
a tambourine, a likeness of his deity, blessed boots,
or a protective shawl.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about his
place of worship, an obscene ritual, or a stash of
golden idols.
