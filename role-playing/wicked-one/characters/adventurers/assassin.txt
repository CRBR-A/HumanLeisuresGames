The Assassin

There are plenty of noble reasons to risk life and
limb clearing out monster-ridden dungeons, but
the assassin doesn't need any of them. Riches are
his only motivator and if he can get in and out
without ever being seen, he's done his job well. When
discovered, though, he has plenty he can do about it.

The assassin is PERSISTENT, but DISHONEST.
He seeks RICHES on adventures.

PASSIVE :
Can always start a scene hidden.

OFFENSIVE MOVES
- snatch item
- silent garrote
- sleeping poison

DEFENSIVE MOVES :
- slip into shadows
- feign death
- smoke bomb

POSSIBLE LOOT :
Depending on your luck, you might find him to be
carrying a cowl of shadows, a color-shifting cloak,
a garrote, a vial of sleeping poison, a smoke bomb,
assorted daggers, softstep boots, a stealth totem, or
an undelivered love letter.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about the
location of his stash, a quiet way into the city, or
a poison even he wouldn't use.
