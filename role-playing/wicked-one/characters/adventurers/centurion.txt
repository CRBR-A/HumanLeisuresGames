The Centurion

The centurion hails from a distant war-torn region
where people prove their worth through triumph
in combat. Even though he wanders now, he still
feels the need to prove his worth to himself. Several
times, he has stumbled out of a small dungeon
barely clinging to life, having cleared it alone.

The centurion is STEADY, but STUBBORN.
He seeks RESPECT on adventures.

Grows more powerful when injured.

OFFENSIVE MOVES:

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find him to be
carrying a helm of dire straits, crushing pauldrons,
a heavily dented breastplate, throwable vambraces,
herculean pteruges, greaves of great thrust, or a
map of an unknown region.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about
combat maneuvers, siege engines, or a cache of
foreign trade goods.
