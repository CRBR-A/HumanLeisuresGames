The Umbral Union

Members:
- Caleb Bannog, The Chaos Mage
- Madras Walker, The Death Knight
- Tasha Culdrom, The Shadowdancer

Origin story: An Impressive Performance
As a noble, Madras is expected to entertain
guests and Tasha's unique talents brought her
into his employ. During her quite impressive
performance, he quickly recognized abilities
beyond mere dancing. At a private dinner
afterwards, Madras and his advisor Caleb got
her to open up about her skillset, then offered
her a spot in their secretive Umbral Union.

Recent adventure: Hello Darkness
The ratfolk under the city quickly learned that
the darkness was no longer a refuge for them.
Once again, the Umbral Union took down one
of the city's foes without reward of any kind.

Tactics: Let Chaos Reign
Caleb's abilities are highly unpredictable,
making formal tactics a bit of a challenge.
Knowing this, they usually let Caleb open up
a fray with a spell, then Madras and Tasha
follow up based on Caleb's opening.
Madras dashes into position, fooling the
monsters to think they face a lone foe. He
then suddenly shifts into his shadow form
allowing Tasha to burst forth from it, blades
rhythmically carving through awestruck
monsters. Madras then feeds on the death
she deals and steps in to cull with his scythe.
Their flexibility is their power, though they
will do anything to protect their identities.
