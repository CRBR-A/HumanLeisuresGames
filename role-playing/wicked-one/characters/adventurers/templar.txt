The Templar

Little is known about the templar and even less about
the strange religious order to which he belongs. He
has a tendency to appear wherever there has been
intense strife, especially when said strife is caused
by monsters. No one remembers seeing him draw
his mace, as his holy commands have yet to fail.

The templar is STEADY, but STUBBORN.
He seeks JUSTICE on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Cannot be turned from his path.

OFFENSIVE MOVES:
- holy word: seek
- holy word: pain

DEFENSIVE MOVES
- holy word: stop

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find him to be
carrying a helm of sanctified vision, a boundless
faith collar, unwavering robes, pious gloves, a mace
of righteous fury, a hallowed holy symbol, or an
unsent letter of confession.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about the
details of his order, an obscene weapon sealed
away, or a forgotten holy site.
