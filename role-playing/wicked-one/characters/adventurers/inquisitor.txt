The Inquisitor

Orphaned at a young age, the inquisitor was
fortunate to be taken in by a monastery. Life there
saved her from hunger, but even the most innocent
of deceptions was met with brutal flagellation. This
cultivated a profound spiritual strength, as well as a
total intolerance of lies.

The inquisitor is PERSISTENT, but STUBBORN.
She seeks JUSTICE on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Excels at seeing through lies and tricks.

OFFENSIVE MOVES:
- terrifying lashes
- barking command
- ignore a trick

DEFENSIVE MOVES:
- scolding eyes
- accept punishment
- hissing defiance

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find her to be
carrying a talisman of penance, a lacerating whip,
a tarnished censor, pious boots, a sacred shroud,
a cracked ceramic doll head, sanctified salt, or
undelivered love letters.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, she might spill her guts about how
to brew a truth serum, a powerful follower of a
dark god, or a bishop's secret.
