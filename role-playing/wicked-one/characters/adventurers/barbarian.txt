The Barbarian

If you can call being really angry a strategy, the
barbarian is a brilliant tactician. Peak physical
strength, seeming immunity to pain, and a
willingness to throw anything or anyone across the
battlefield to win the day makes him a formidable
foe. Even death won't slow his bottomless rage.

The barbarian is CONFIDENT, but DUMB.
He seeks JUSTICE on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Keeps fighting when he should be dead.

OFFENSIVE MOVES
- whirlwind slash
- mighty roar
- toss an ally

DEFENSIVE MOVES
- flex muscles
- break bonds
- toss an enemy

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find him to be
carrying a horned helm, leather armor of hoisting,
suregrip bracers, an ancestral totem, long jump
boots, an enormous great sword, or a crudely
painted likeness of a muscular woman.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about a place
where the ancestors speak, a revered weapon, or
a gold mine.
