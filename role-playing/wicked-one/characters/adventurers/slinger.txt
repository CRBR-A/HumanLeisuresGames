The Slinger

As a halfling, the slinger has heard every joke
about stature there is, but has always found that a
well-aimed rock quickly stops any laughter at his
expense. In truth, his compact size is perfect for
navigating small dungeon passages and slipping
through the legs of the monsters calling them home.

The slinger is OPTIMISTIC, but INDECISIVE.
He seeks JUSTICE on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Excels against anyone bigger than him.

OFFENSIVE MOVES:
- stunning stone
- hail of stones
- staredown

DEFENSIVE MOVES:
- run through legs
- sucker punch
- reposition

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find him to be
carrying halfling golden mead, an ammo pouch,
a stunstone, elusive slacks, a speedy sling, a power
sling, a touchless tunic, a hood of harrowing gaze,
blessed fruit pies, or a letter from his proud father.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about a
wealthy village, a hidden mead stockpile, or an
owlbear den.
