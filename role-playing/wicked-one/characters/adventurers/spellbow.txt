The Spellbow

Arcane archery is an extremely effective discipline,
though few have the necessary talents to master
it. The spellbow has perfected every shot, going
so far as to invent a few of her own. Even when
fired around a corner or into a different room, her
fletchings always find their mark.

The spellbow is CLEVER, but GREEDY.
She seeks THRILLS on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Imbues each arrow with an elemental effect.

OFFENSIVE MOVES:
- massive volley
- corrosive arrow
- homing arrow

DEFENSIVE MOVES:
- illusion arrow
- grease arrow
- teleportation arrow

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find her to
be carrying string wax, a braided unicorn-tail
bowstring, a components satchel, an endless quiver,
an iron-stitched tunic, sure-release gloves, trackless
boots, or a small carved horse.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, she might spill her guts about their
arcane teacher, rumors about a mythical bow, or
a monster prison.
