The Knight

Being of noble birth and nobler intention, the knight
loyally serves his kingdom to the death. After years
of elite training, he is surprisingly agile and can
continue brandishing his lance despite the added
weight of several skewered foes. It's been ages since
his armor has gotten more than a scratch on it.

The knight is HONEST, but COCKY.
He seeks RESPECT on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Is nearly impervious to physical damage.

OFFENSIVE MOVES
- unbreakable wall
- skewer
- unstoppable march

DEFENSIVE MOVES
- swap places
- bulwark
- code of honor

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find him to
be carrying an impressive plume, a maiden's
favor, proud plate armor, a kinetic kite shield, an
unbluntable lance, joint lubrication, a military map,
or a hay-stuffed toy bear.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about the
princess's hiding spot, a weak point in the city
walls, or the tomb of valor.
