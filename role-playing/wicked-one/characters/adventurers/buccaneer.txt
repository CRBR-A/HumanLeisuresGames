The Buccaneer

The buccaneer is well-traveled and accustomed
to the finer things, largely thanks to goods from
merchant vessels frequently finding their way onto
her ship. Though frequently at sea, she always keeps
her ear to the winds that fill her sail for rumors of
riches to be had on land.

The buccaneer is GENEROUS, but COCKY.
She seeks RICHES on adventures.

PASSIVE: 
Is nearly impossible to pin down.

OFFENSIVE MOVES:
- swinging entrance
- trigger trap shot
- sleeping poison bolt

DEFENSIVE MOVES
- funny line
- tuck and roll
- fake injury

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find her to be
carrying a scintillating scimitar, a hand crossbow,
a wayfarer's waist belt, wavemaster boots, a vial
of fake blood, a self-tying rope, sleep poison, or an
unassembled ship in a bottle.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, she might spill her guts about
buried treasure, a cove that leads deep under the
city, or a sea leviathan's favorite snack.
