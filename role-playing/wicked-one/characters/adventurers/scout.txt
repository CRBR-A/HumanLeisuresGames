The Scout

The scout can be found pressing at the borders
between the known and unknown. Such places are
rife with danger, but with his uncanny sense of
direction, keen eye for peril, and unerring precision,
he invariably returns, eagerly awaited by those
looking for tales from the frontiers of civilization.

The scout is HELPFUL, but STUBBORN.
He seeks EXPLORATION on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Excels at spotting traps and hazards.

OFFENSIVE MOVES:
- know the way
- suppressive fire
- trick shot

DEFENSIVE MOVES:
- warning shot
- spot an exit
- shoot terrain

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find him to be
carrying a masterwork bow, an enchanted quiver,
a ghillie suit, a clearsight helm, gloves of steady
hand, an acid arrow, an explosive arrow, a grappling
arrow, or softstep boots.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about a hard
to reach treasure, hidden routes of travel, or a
noble's plans for expansion.
