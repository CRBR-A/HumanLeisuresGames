The Defender

Anyone who says the “best defense is a good offense”
has never stood behind this guy. Those looking to get
past him will have to get near him, often leading to
them ending up as a new stain on his shield. It takes
a bit for him to get moving, but when he does, you
don't want to be what helps him stop.

The defender is STEADY, but INDECISIVE.
He seeks CHALLENGE on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Extends strong defense to nearby allies.

OFFENSIVE MOVES:
- shield bash
- bull rush
- step on trap

DEFENSIVE MOVES:
- bodyguard
- stand ground
- watchful eyes

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find him to
be carrying reinforced greaves, a tireless tunic,
pierceless plate mail, a tower shield, a helm of
awareness, charging pauldrons, confidential orders,
or an ornate dwarven mess kit.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about city
defenses, military installments, or another major
threat to the region.
