Whetbone

When the bosses are between raids and there haven't
been any invasions to break the monotony, they
sometimes have to hone their skills on imps. During
one such exercise, Whetbone took a particularly deep
gash. The bosses' subsequent swings effortlessly
bisected their imp targets. It seems Whetbone's blood
has some special properties.

DUNGEON ROLE
Whetbone now serves as the bosses' personal
scabbard. At any given time, he is honored with four
to five weapons piercing his flesh. Just imagine how
useful a sheath would be if it could enhance your
weapons and hand them to you.

DURING INVASIONS
Invading light-hearts are incredibly
dangerous but being surrounded by the
dungeon's bosses and pincushioned
by their weapons, Whetbone couldn't
feel safer. As an added benefit, there
is always a moment of horrified
confusion on the adventurers' faces
when the bosses hack into one of
their own before pursuing them.
