Fewcher

Fewcher has always had a perfect biological clock but
imps have little need for timekeeping, so it's just an
annoying ticking he willfully ignores. He had never
told anyone about his quirk, but it slipped after he told
one of the bosses that they had been choking him for
exactly 187 seconds. This led to him getting a new jobâ€¦
and more choking as punishment for interrupting.

DUNGEON ROLE
Little to no sunlight makes its way into the dungeon, so if
you need to know what day it is, you need Fewcher. The
bosses even let him use the enchanted hourglass, but
watching the sand fall all day and night is boring him to
insanity. Most of his time is now spent trying to smash the
hourglass - which is apparently magically impervious.

DURING INVASIONS
Fewcher always seeks out invading heroes
when they try and get through the
dungeon. They're sometimes capable of
strong magics that just might be able
to destroy the hourglass he's come
to loathe. Hitting them with it a few
times is usually all the motivation
they need to try.
