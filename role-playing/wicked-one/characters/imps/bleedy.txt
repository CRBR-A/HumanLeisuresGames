Bleedy

Few imps have the privilege of being purposefully
spawned by the dungeon bosses. They were tired of
training with dummies that neither bleed or scream,
so they threw a heavily used dummy into the imp
spawning pool and Bleedy is what crawled back out.
He's fully articulated, sprays like a fountain, and
releases the most realistic howls of pain!

DUNGEON ROLE
Bleedy's role is deceptively simple. Get hit, bleed,
scream, and repeat. Over time though, he's realized
there's more to it than that. If they miss too many
times, let them land a few to boost their confidence.
When they really sink one in deep, offer congratulations, 
but only after a satisfying shriek.

DURING INVASIONS
Due to being an animated dummy,
the creation magics that made
him also prevent him from being
able to attack anyone. So instead,
he taunts the heroes into attacking
then scampers off with their
weapons lodged firmly in his flesh.
