Fonix

A couple of years ago during a rough time in the
dungeon, the imps tried to unionize. Their negotiations
better than you'd expect - in return for being able to stay
alive and in the dungeon, they simply had to promise to
never unionize again. They were even allowed to keep
up their safety awareness signs, though likely only
because Fonix is the only imp that can read.

DUNGEON ROLE
The signs were originally designed to inform the
dungeon how many imps were wounded, though they
number quickly grew higher than Fonix knew how to
write - so he now just notes the days between serious
accidents. He's still forgotten what comes after five.

DURING INVASIONS
Noticing that adventurers always stop to try
and decipher his sign, he now hides near
it 
DURING INVASIONS. Once they're
scratching their heads, he pops
out and splashes them in the eyes
with paint. It's made out of ichor
and dirt, so it sometimes even
blinds them for a bit.
