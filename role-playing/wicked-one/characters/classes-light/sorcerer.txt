acquiring arcane knowledge, striking
occult deals, or creating magic items.

Counterspell: On a success when resisting magical effects, you also (choose
one): absorb the spell and clear 1 stress - establish a quirk about the caster’s
power - reflect the spell at the caster.

Familiar: You’re magically bonded to a small critter, no bigger than a cat. You
can speak telepathically while it’s close by. Choose two actions that it excels at,
which you roll your own Invoke for. You roll 0d on anything else. It’s knocked
out of a scene when bloodied and magically returns during recovery. You can
spend stress to cast a tier 1 spell through it.

Grand Sorcery: You can choose a second path for your Sorcery ability
and can cast from any sorcery path with only a single magic focus.

Overload: You open yourself to a torrent of power. You take +1d when you
go hard with a spell, but you can’t resist any consequences from the roll. On a
critical, you clear 1 stress.

Sorcery: You have mastered a magic path (choose one): enchantment -
evocation - force mastery - illusion - pyromancy. You can spend stress to
Invoke tier 2 and tier 3 spells of your path.

Spellforge: You gain a downtime action which you can only use to incant
rituals to make magic items. These rituals also require one less special
requirement than usual.
