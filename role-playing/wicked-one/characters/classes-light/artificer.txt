even on a failure. You gain a downtime action which you can only use to brew
concoctions.

project, the downtime action isn’t consumed. You also gain a downtime action
which you can only use to craft.

Faith in Science: You fully believe in your creations. You take +1d when you go
hard with a concoction or contraption, but you can’t resist any consequences
from the roll. On a critical, you clear 1 stress.

Ingenuity: You can spend stress to perform an incredible feat of creation,
like mixing concoctions on the fly to create a powerful combined effect, slapping
together a temporary simple contraption, or ignoring volatility in science
creations.

Pride: You instill a deep sense of yourself into anything you create. When you
or someone else rolls a critical using something you crafted, you gain a heart.

Scrutiny: You can spend stress to establish a flaw in a structure or some
machinery you can see. You take +1d when you act on that knowledge.
