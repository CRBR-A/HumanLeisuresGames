combing through the temple archives,
making a sacrifice to your god, or preaching to believers.

Bulwark: You’re the rock on which your allies lean. You take +1d when
resisting consequences for an ally. On a success, the ally takes +1d on any
follow-up action.

Channeling: You can spend stress to Invoke tier 2 and tier 3 spells of your
chosen deity’s domains. Each god has two domains which act as magic paths.
Define your god and their domains, plus any limitations they might impose.

Holy Rites: You gain a downtime action which you can only use to incant
rituals. On a success when incanting a ritual, you gain a heart.

Rebuke: You teach those who challenge you a harsh lesson. On a success
when resisting, you take +1d if you immediately act against them. On a critical
when resisting, you also (choose one): convert them to your god’s path - strike
fear in their heart.

Sanctifier: Draw a 4-segment clock on your sheet. Tick it once each time you
cleanse something defiled or ruined that is antithetical to your god’s domains.
When the clock is full, a tier 2 ritual immediately manifests in that location
and you start a new clock.

Smite: Designate a weapon as your holy weapon. It’s now your magic focus.
On a success when attacking someone with it, you can spend stress to
immediately affect the target with a tier 1 spell without rolling.
