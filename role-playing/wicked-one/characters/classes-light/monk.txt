training with a great master, surveying a
target’s strength, or long periods of intense meditation.

Acolyte: You have a trainee, taking your hireling spot. They have the mindset
(loyal) and companion upgrades. Upgrades cannot be purchased, however
for every ability you have, they also earn an upgrade (choose one): equipped -
mindset (fearless) - trained - versatile.

Control: You fluidly control a fight. On a success when resisting an attack
in close combat, you can also (choose one): disarm them - redirect the attack -
reposition them nearby.

Fearless: You know the body is just a vessel. You take +1d when you go hard
and put your own body on the line, but you can’t resist any consequences from
the roll. You also gain a defense against fear or intimidation.

Joy of Battle: You love nothing more than your own excellence in battle. On
a critical while engaged in combat, you clear 1 stress and gain a heart.

Martial Arts: You can spend stress to perform an incredible feat of athletics,
like facing off against a group of foes on equal footing, maneuvering up or
across nearly any surface, or snatching an arrow out of the air.

Willpower: Your mind and body do not fold easily. On a failure when
resisting, you can immediately roll an extra 1d that counts towards the roll. If
the result is a success, it counts as a critical.
