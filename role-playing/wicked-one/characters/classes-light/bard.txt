an evening spent socializing, performing
for an influential person, or acquiring information from contacts.

Intuition: Others are an open book to you. You can spend stress to establish
a targetâ€™s emotional state, though it must be a reasonable emotion for them to
be feeling. You take +1d when you act on that knowledge.

Masterful Liar: You excel at lying when you go all in on a falsehood. You
take +1d when you go hard to tell a lie. On a success, you gain a heart.

Opportunist: You take +1d on a roll when acting immediately after an ally
rolls a success on a resistance roll. How do you leverage their success to your
own advantage?

Strings: You can spend stress to have an ally remember your words or song
in their head, allowing them to reroll a failure. If they roll a success, you gain a
heart. What advice or motivation did you previously impart on them?

Weaving the Web: On a success during a flashback or downtime action
to interact with contacts, you gain a heart. You also gain a downtime action
which you can only use to contact a friend, faction, or other NPC.

Wordplay: On a success when resisting with Banter, Threaten, or Trick,
you can also (choose one): deflect blame - plant a false idea - have the GM reveal
a secret.
