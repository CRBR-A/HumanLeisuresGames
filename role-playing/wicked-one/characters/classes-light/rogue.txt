snatching something valuable, lying
to create opportunity, or stashing some items.

Poisoner: Making or procuring poisons is second nature for you. You have a
steady supply of the following tier 1 concoction poisons: blinding - disorienting
- slowing - nauseating. You also gain two supply slots which you can only use
for them.

Pounce: You recognize the perfect timing to strike. You take +1d when you catch someone by surprise. On a critical, you clear 1 stress.

Prowler: You can spend stress to perform an incredible feat of agility,
like slipping unimpeded through a mob, leaping safely from a high tower,
or hiding in plain sight.

Slippery: Youâ€™re tough to pin down. On a success when resisting an enemy
attack, you can also (choose one): disappear from their sight - pick their pocket
- reposition behind them.

Stalker: Your lurking presence forces foolish action. On a success while
moving stealthily, NPCs near you (choose one): do something stupid due to
paranoia - reveal a secret.

Unseen Hand: When you assist an ally, you only take consequences if they
roll a failure. If they roll a critical, you clear 1 stress. How do you help without
anyone knowing?
