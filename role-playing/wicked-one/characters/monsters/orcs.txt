> ### Orcs
> **Orcs** are foul mannered, callous creatures. Theyâ€™re stubborn and overly sensitive to slights from others. They tend to approach problems with the first solution that comes to mind. Orcs generally don't even enjoy their own company. An orc might say:
> > "What are you looking at, maggot?"  
> > "Bleedin' is good for ya. Shake it off."  
> > "Stop whining and get in the catapult."
