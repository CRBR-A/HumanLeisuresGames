## Hunter
> Ruthless & Tenacious Trackers

You’re at home running with the beasts of the forest. Relentlessly chasing down prey brings you closer to the animal inside of you. And yet, you're deliberate, never missing a sign, always on the trail. And when you finally corner your target, there’s no hesitation to finish it. You begin play with the following **core ability**:

Thrill of the Hunt: You can spend stress to establish a small, momentary weakness in your prey. You gain +effect when you exploit this on your next roll to stalk, catch, or bring them down. On a success, you gain a dark heart.

Things a Hunter would have thought to do: *setting a trap*, *scouting out a location*, or *hunting up some food*.

### Hunter Abilities

#### Feral Senses

Animal blood runs through your veins, causing your senses to extend twice as far as normal. You take +1d when tracking or surveying an area. You also gain a defense against surprise.

#### Grit

You don't go down easy. On a failure when resisting, you can immediately roll an extra 1d that counts towards the roll. If the result is a success, it counts as a critical.

#### Hunting Pet

You have a hunting pet or pack instead of minions. It has the companion upgrade and knows tricks (choose two): *cause confusion* - *fetch* - *herd prey* - *locate prey* - *surprise attack*. Your pet takes +1d when performing known tricks.

#### Scavenger

On a success while surveying or traversing a risky area, you can (choose one): *find a piece of mundane gear* - *tick an edge crafting clock* - *harvest a tier 2 concoction*.

#### Scout

You make a habit of roaming the surface and scouting out targets. While choosing a raid plan, you can establish a weakness you know about in your target’s defenses. During the raid, you can also spend stress to establish a second fact.

#### Trick Shots

You can pull off improbable (but not impossible) shots with a ranged weapon, like ricocheting a projectile off a wall or shooting through one target and hitting another. You ignore any circumstances towards effect from the difficulty, but you must explain how you pulled off the shot.

#### Wild Knowledge

You can spend stress to establish a fact about plants, animals, or 
the weather. You take +1d when you act on that knowledge.
