| 12 | A cart full of ale, but how will you pull it home? |
| 13 | Holy vestments and incense, but several priests stand in your way. |

| 35 | Several goats in their pen, but they're mean as hell. |
| 36 | An ancient atlas, but it's linked to its golem guardian. |

| 43 | A suit of armor on a stand, but it's heavy and welded together. |
| 44 | Stacks and stacks of cheese wheels, but no way to carry all of them. |
| 45 | An enormous luxurious carpet, but it has lots of heavy furniture on it. |

| 56 | Songbirds in a cage, but they're incredibly noisy and draw attention. |
| 61 | A garden full of exotic flowers, but some of the plants have poisonous thorns. |
| 62 | Gargoyle statue, but how do you get it off the wall? |
| 63 | A fantastic ceremonial headdress, but it's protected by the ghost of its former owner. |
