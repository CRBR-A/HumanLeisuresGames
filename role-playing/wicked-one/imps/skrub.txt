Skrub

At any given moment, Skrub can be found hauling all
manner of nasty viscera. All the other imps avoid him
at all costs while he's at work. It's not that they are
bothered by the gore. They want nothing to do with
his inevitable puns about getting a “leg up” or offering
a “lending hand”. If he has one he finds particularly
clever, he will take the long way through the dungeon
to find an audience.

DUNGEON ROLE
To one unfamiliar with imp hierarchy, Skrub's job may
appear menial but it's actually an honored position.
The bosses take great pride in making the bloody
messes he's in charge of cleaning up. Morale is always
high when Skrub has a lot of work to do.

DURING INVASIONS
Skrub has noticed a strange quirk about
heroes in the way they react to mounds
of effluent body parts. They seem to get
sickened and horrified by it for some
reason. It's not his job to wonder why
though. He just makes extra glorious
mounds for them when they insist
on invading.
