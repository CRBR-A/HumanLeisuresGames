Bugclimb

Back when he was simply known as Bug, Bugclimb's job
was to rid the dungeon of insects, which he frequently
did by eating them. After clearing out an entire hive of
weird glowing beetles and one wicked stomachache,
he realized he could climb walls and ceilings. It's rare
to see him touching the ground ever since then.

DUNGEON ROLE
In any decent dungeon, there's always a need to hang
things from the ceiling. Whether it's slain adventurers,
imprisoned imps, or the bosses' birthday decorations,
he can do it with ease. He pulls double duty since he was
never replaced as exterminator so he still eats his fill of
insects. At least the tasty ones are easier to get to now.

DURING INVASIONS
Bugclimb loves when adventurers try
to invade the dungeon - it gives him an
opportunity to experiment with things
to drop on them. From a high, shadowy
corner, he tries to drop the following
items that have worked well for him
in the past: a big rock, rat, sharpened
horseshoe, handfuls of sand, hornet
nest, dead rat, and a bag of spiders.
