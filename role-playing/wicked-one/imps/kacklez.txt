Kacklez

Imps have a surprisingly complex social hierarchy. One
of the biggest factors in their position is their cackle.
After all, what good is an evil act if not punctuated with
evil laughter? No other imp's cackle comes close to
Kacklez, which is so full of ungodly mirth that it causes
real physical pain to the source of his dark joy.

DUNGEON ROLE
Kacklez is sort of in between jobs right now. He used
to be in charge of coordinating all the imps via a huge
bullhorn. During one of his announcements, he saw
another imp get his wing slammed in a door. The
resulting cackle traveled through the bullhorn and
bloodied the ears of every living thing in the dungeon.

DURING INVASIONS
The most surefire way to get a cackle out of
Kacklez is someone getting hurt, and
when adventurers come ransacking,
there's no shortage of that. It doesn't
matter whether it's the heroes or his
fellow imps, it's all hilarious to him as
he follows them through the dungeon,
laughing to his dark hearts content
while the psychic damage takes its toll.
