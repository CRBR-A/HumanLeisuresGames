Cesspian

Every race has those spawned with a touch for the
dramatic in their soul. Imps are no exception. Cesspian
has achieved a surprising level of fame performing
acts on the dungeon stage, such as Apocalimps Now,
Revengers: Impfinity War, Impception, and the role
that won him his Bosscar, Forrest Imp. Now, he wants
to go back to his roots and return to Shodway.

DUNGEON ROLE
Cesspian is far too famous to be assigned a dangerous
role. Instead, when the imps are in uproar about some
trivial massacre, the bosses encourage him to make
the rounds, signing autographs and raising morale.
The imparazzi used to be an issue but the bosses killed
them for being too vile.

DURING INVASIONS
Cesspian saves his best performances
for the heroes that ever insist on
raiding the dungeon, as they are his
toughest critics. During the last
invasion, he was so in tune with
his rendition of the soliloquy from
Implet that even the strongest willed
hero was held in rapt attention.
