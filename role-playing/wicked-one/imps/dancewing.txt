Dancewing

Spawned in all shapes, sizes, and demeanors, there are
innumerable ways to describe imps. Graceful, though,
is still a rarity. While most celebrate their evildoings
with a mad cackle, Dancewing celebrates with sinister
pirouettes. Does that make him any less evil?

DUNGEON ROLE
After a failed raid or when dealing with some terrible
calamity, the bosses often turn their ire on the imps -
the perfect moment for Dancewing to shine. He begins
spinning and leaping, all to the din of the Wicked Ones
throwing everything in sight at him. While he has
saved the lives of countless imps, in truth he only does
it to sate the dance in his little dark heart.

DURING INVASIONS
As it happens, the only people who
are more enraged by a dancing imp
are adventurers, who invariably
see it as a slight to their heroism.
While they give chase, Dancewing
loves to ciseaux over the traps the
poor bastards aren't yet privy to.
