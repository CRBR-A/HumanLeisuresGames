Cagey

No one, Cagey included, can quite remember what he
did to get put in his cage in the first place. He's been
begging to be let out but nobody seems to listen to an
imprisoned imp. He has been in his cage so long that
his horns have grown around the bars so he's not sure
he could come out if someone opened it anyway.

DUNGEON ROLE
There is not much purpose to be had while
forlornly swinging from a chain. Still, he serves
as a strong reminder for all the other imps to not
do… whatever it is Cagey did.

DURING INVASIONS
Peeking through his heavily rusted bars,
Cagey has seen countless hero invasions.
On one such occasion, he learned the
Light tongue word for “help” from a priest
that stumbled on a spike trap. Now when
adventurers are making trouble, he yells
“Help!” to lure them away from the sanctum.
