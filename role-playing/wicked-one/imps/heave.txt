Heave

Hygiene is by no means a priority for any imp, but in
Heave's case, his lack thereof is legendary. Everyone
unfamiliar with him assumes he got his name because
of the rocks he's always carrying. If they're unfortunate
enough to catch a whiff of him though, they learn the
real reason their most recent meal makes a resurgence.

DUNGEON ROLE
When imps like Heave aren't given a specific
assignment, they are expected to toil away at the endless
work the dungeon provides. Like most such imps, he
found a way out of it. He painted a wooden cutout to look
like a stack of rocks and developed a body odor so horrid
that no one gets close enough to figure him out.

DURING INVASIONS
When the light-hearts come snooping,
no one wants to get close enough to
warn Heave. He's stumbled upon a
group of raiding adventurers multiple
times. Thankfully, his malodorous
aura is even more effective against
above-grounders, who rarely have the
constitution to keep their lunch.
