Swimspeed

Swimming is a rare ability among imps, but Swimspeed
was spawned with a knack for it. Knowing the other
imps are jealous, he perfected his diving technique
to gloat whenever his skills are called into use. This
eventually backfired when the dungeon bosses noticed
his fancy maneuver and started making him jump into
the creature swamp just for their entertainment.

DUNGEON ROLE
When something needs to be moved into, out
of, or around water, Swimspeed is proud to help.
Unfortunately, that is not a very common need in most
dungeons. To avoid having to do general imp labor,
he will often steal important tools and throw them in
the nearest water hazard before making a grandiose
display in retrieving them.

DURING INVASIONS
Once the bubbles stop and the adventurers are
clearly dead, Swimspeed goes to work. Only
he can get down there to loot their bodies
- and why shouldn't he keep a little for
himself? Besides, deep underwater is
the perfect place for a private hoard.
