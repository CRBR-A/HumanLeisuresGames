Mazforchun

Mazforchun was spawned during a total lunar
eclipse, one of the most foreboding imp omens there
are. Since then, her life has been one instance of
seemingly impossible bad luck after another. She's
won the lottery five times, which sounds great, but in
the dungeon that means the bosses pull your name
from the brutal beatings hat. She's also been struck by
lightning twiceâ€¦ while in the dungeon.

DUNGEON ROLE
At a loss for anything else she could do, Maz was told
to just help the other imps stay hydrated. After the
incident that took the lives of four imps, the pod of
weredolphins, and the visiting Kobold witchdoctor, her
job became staying as far from everyone as possible.

DURING INVASIONS
Because her luck is so consistently
terrible, Maz can weaponize it. When
adventurers kick in the entrance, all she
has to do is follow them around and try to
stay out of sight. At worst, her black hole
of luck makes them miss a lot, but at
best, they struggle even more with the
dungeon defenses awaiting them.
