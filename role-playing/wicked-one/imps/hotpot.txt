Hotpot

When the bosses get back from a tough raid, they
come back hungry. With imps in charge of the kitchen
though, it's rare they are able to make something
palatable (or even edible). That all changed when a
fateful, but not uncommon, accident lead to Hotpot
stewing for a bit. The resulting broth had the Wicked
Ones demanding more.

DUNGEON ROLE
Having produced the only dish the bosses have ever
enjoyed, Hotpot was put in charge of the dungeon's
kitchens. He is frantically trying to learn how to make
something the bosses enjoy more than his special
broth - which has has continuously failed to do.

DURING INVASIONS
Hotspot is genuinely unsure if the
threat of invading heroes wouldn't be
a welcome reprieve from the stress of
the kitchen and being boiled over and
over again. Still, he is prepared for
the event with an arsenal of knives,
forks, and in a pinch, spoons. If all
else fails, there is an ever-boiling
cauldron he can spill on them.
