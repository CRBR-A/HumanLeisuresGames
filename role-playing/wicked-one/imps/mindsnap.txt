Mindsnap

Normally calling an imp mean is redundant, but it's the
only way to describe Mindsnap. While he was never
exactly wired right, a swift kick from one of the boss's
boots further scrambled his brain. His tendency to
suddenly begin biting, scratching, and clawing anyone
that gets too close has resulted in Mindsnap having his
own shadowy corner of the dungeon.

DUNGEON ROLE
Officially, Mindsnap doesn't have an assigned job.
However, after a creature strayed too close to his
alcove, the bosses have started using him to gauge the
strength of the dungeon's monstrous denizens. If a
beast can leave his shadows alive, it can stay.

DURING INVASIONS
Mindsnap doesn't distinguish heroes from
anything else that bleeds, but thanks to the
other wily imps, he is very much a part of
the dungeon's defenses. Several cleverly
placed tricks are designed to lead
unsuspecting adventurers directly
into the radius of his endless frenzy.
