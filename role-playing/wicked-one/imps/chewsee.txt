Chewsee

Imp spawning is a fickle, oft unpredictable magic
that sometimes results in imps with unique abilities.
Chewsee was belched into the world with the ability
to see psychic visions of how something died. All he
has to do is eat part of its remains. Even for a dungeon
dweller, he's been commanded to eat some pretty
gnarly stuff - which is probably why he's the only
vegetarian imp when eating just for hunger's sake.

DUNGEON ROLE
Chewsee is one of only a handful of imps allowed
into the dungeon sanctum where his talent is put
to constant, rarely important use. The only time the
bosses are legitimately concerned with his visions is
when they are arguing over who got the kill.

DURING INVASIONS
Spending most of his time in the
sanctum, Chewsee has never directly
interacted with invading light-hearts.
His skills are called into use when the
adventurers manage to escape. He
nibbles on the dungeon denizens they
managed to kill so the bosses can track
them down.
