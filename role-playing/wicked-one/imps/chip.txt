Chip

Except for the bosses, Chip has asked every single
living creature in the dungeon which one they think
is cooler, pickaxe or shovel. Assuming growling and
teeth gnashing means pickaxe, even the wargs agree.
So why, Chip wonders, does the shovel guy get so much
credit? Chip actually shapes the rock. Digspeed just
cleans up the dirt.

DUNGEON ROLE
One of the many reasons the pickaxe is superior is
because when the dungeon is not expanding, Chip can
still make himself useful mining for loot. He's already
found a bunch of stuff the bosses were happy about,
like a vein of hell quartz, petrified witch's wart, an
yrthak skull, and a void tar pit.

DURING INVASIONS
Chip normally wouldn't care when
a bunch of light-hearts invade but
Digspeed always tries to go after them
with that stupid sharpened shovel of
his. That means Chip has to go, too, to
show everyone that a pick makes a
much better weapon.
