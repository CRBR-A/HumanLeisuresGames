Digspeed

From the moment he appeared as a newspawned
babe, Digspeed never stopped crying. He was on the
verge of being kicked from the dungeon when he
heard the sound that would help him find purpose. He
never again shed a tear after hearing that sweet ring of
metal on earth.

DUNGEON ROLE
When a dungeon is doing well, it expands - and when dirt
gets in the way of that, you call Digspeed. He's evil with a
shovel and has defeated three dark dwarves in digging
challenges. He looks forward to the day a dwarf is foolish
enough to visit for some unfriendly competition.

DURING INVASIONS
Digspeed can also be handy when adventurers
come poking around. He has a sharpened
shovel he's dubbed “aches of spades”
that he happily uses to put some
dirt in their eyes. If he gets in over his
head, he can dig a pit trap with ease to
buy some time to go warn those higher
up the dungeon hierarchy.
