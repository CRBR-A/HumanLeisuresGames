Goldwhiff

Combining the greedy nature of imps with the ability
to smell gold and other treasure makes a problematic
mixture. Goldwhiff can't help but to follow his nose and
has discovered the bosses' secret stash multiple times.
He has the good sense not to take anything, which is
why he's still around, but it creeps them out the way he
sniffs their booty.

DUNGEON ROLE
Mainly to get some distance from him but also because
he might find something of value, the bosses have
paired Goldwhiff with Chip, the pickaxe imp. Together,
they wander the basement levels trying to small and
uncover anything of value.

DURING INVASIONS
Unless it's a bunch of those annoying
pious monks, adventurers carry
enough loot that he can immediately
smell them. There's not much
Goldwhiff can do to fight them, but
should they make their way back
out of the dungeon with some of the
bosses' loot, he can track them down
to get it back.
