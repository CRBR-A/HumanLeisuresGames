Swellthumb

Imps love bickering over who is the most overworked
in the dungeon, but no one wants to play that game
with Swellthumb. To keep up with the Wicked Ones'
constant demands for new rooms, he frequently
goes several days without sleep. His tendency to fall
asleep while hammering earned him his name, but
sometimes he smashes his claws just to stay awake.

DUNGEON ROLE
Technically, Swellthumb is in charge of training imp
builder crews. When the blame fell on him for the
werewolf cage repair incident, and the flame trap
misfire, and the chasm bridge collapse, he decided it
would be easier to take matters into his own hands
rather than continue training new crews.

DURING INVASIONS
No dungeon dweller hates adventurers
more than Swellthumb. He can only
watch in horror as they delight in
smashing, burning, and sanctifying
everything he's worked so hard to
build. When heroes come knocking,
he frantically reinforces the doors
containing his hardest projects.
