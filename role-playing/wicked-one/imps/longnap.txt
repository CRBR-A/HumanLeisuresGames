Longnap

With a keener mind than most imps, Longnap has a
knack for locating the kind of loot that keeps the bosses
happy. What's best is that when you're the one finding
the good stuff, they don't make you carry it. The glares of
his fellow, overworked imps don't disturb his rest at all.

DUNGEON ROLE
Yet another perk to finding the good stuff is being put
in charge of inventory. Between siestas, Longnap can
be found counting (and pocketing) coin. He tries not
to think about it but if he were to fall into the wrong
hands, his enemies might try to get him to give up the
location of the best loot. He's convinced himself he
would never talk.

DURING INVASIONS
If pesky heroes are able to cause enough chaos to
wake him up, Longnap's higher functioning brain
(relatively speaking) comes in handy again.
He knows to bide his time and wait for the
perfect opportunity. When the heroes
find themselves struggling with a trap
or dungeon creature, he does his best
to make their situation way worse.
