Robby

All imps are spawned with a streak of jealousy, but in
Robby's case, it's an uncontrollable compulsion for
thievery. The first offense for theft in the dungeon
is to be hanged from a dagger through the hand and
measures escalate quickly after that. Fortunately for
Robby, the bosses don't pay enough attention to the
imps to realize he's already been tacked to every wall.

DUNGEON ROLE
Robby's job is the closest thing to a medic that imps
have. Even on the very rare occasion he's not pinned, no
one sees him about their injuries. His patients always
realized too late that Robby had taken everything from
them, which is impressive because imps don't use
pockets.

DURING INVASIONS
The last three times heroes invaded, Robby
was serving another first offense. When
they enter whatever room he happens to
be stuck to, he hangs limp, pretending to be
dead. After the good-hearts have dismissed
him, he frees himself and tries his hardest to
steal something. If things go bad, he always
has a dagger at hand.
