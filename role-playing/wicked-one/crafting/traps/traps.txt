### Traps

Traps are static, well-hidden defenses that are meant to surprise and maim any unwary adventurer wandering your halls. Each trap consists of a mechanism which details what the trap does and a trigger which details what sets it off. The player in charge of the trap narrates the results of the trap roll. Trap rolls deal damage as if they were ticking a clock, with each tick doing half a heart of damage.

The **mechanism** details how the trap is effective against invaders. Choose from the mechanisms below or make up your own:
| 2d6 |  Trap Mechanisms |
| -- | -- |
| 1 | crushing wall |
| 2 | darts |
| 3 | spikes |
| 4 | boulder |
| 5 | saw blade |
| 6 | pendulum blade |
| 7 | gas |
| 8 | lightning coil |
| 9 | swing blade |
| 10 | explosion |
| 11 | pitfall |
| 12 | floor blade |

The **trigger** is how the trap is activated. Depending on the nature of the trigger, some adventurers might not even activate it such as a levitating mage not setting off a pressure plate. Choose from the triggers below or make up your own:
| 2d6 | Trap Triggers |
| -- | -- |
| 1 | pressure plate |
| 2 | tripwire |
| 3 | magical |
| 4 | detection |
| 5 | illusion |
| 6 | disguise |
| 7 | sound |
| 8 | item removal |
| 9 | false door |
| 10 | sentry |
| 11 | wrong choice |
| 12 | false lever |

Traps are rated from tier 1 to tier 3, based on how deadly they are and chosen by the player when it's crafted. A tier 1 trap is somewhat easy to avoid, such as a doorknob trapped with a poison needle. Tier 2 traps are deadly, like a giant swinging blade attached to a pressure plate. Tier 3 traps are the deadliest, likely to affect multiple adventurers, like a tripwire that releases an enormous rolling stone ball.
