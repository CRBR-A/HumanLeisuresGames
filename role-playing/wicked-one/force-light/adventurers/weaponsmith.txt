The Weaponsmith

Some weapons go on to be greater legends than
those who wielded them and the weaponsmith is
determined to create the next such weapon. To craft
such fine armaments, one must also know how to
brandish them, so the few breaks he takes from his
forge are used to hone his skill with his creations.

The weaponsmith is HONEST, but COCKY.
He seeks CHALLENGE on adventures.

PASSIVE:
Always has the right weapon for the job.

OFFENSIVE MOVES
- confident laugh
- snatch weapon
- break weapon

DEFENSIVE MOVES

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find him to be
carrying a warpick, a quick-study helm, a keen
short sword, twin short spears, a smith's apron,
a wounding rapier, a pauldron of heft, greaves of
spurious talent, or a notebook of creation notes.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about the
pieces of a mythical weapon, a spirit forge, or a
weakness in the army's armor.
