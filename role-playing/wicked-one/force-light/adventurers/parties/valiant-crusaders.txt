Origin story: Sending ‘Em Back to Hell
Herb had tracked the demons that killed his
brother back to their lair and steeled himself
to head in alone. Suddenly, he heard a sound
behind him and turned to see Mathias there.
“Herb Lidol? The goddess has sent me. You'll
not be standing alone today, my friend.” Just
behind him stood Patrelius, “I'm just here to
kill some demons. Let's get to it.”

recent adventure: Proving His Worth
Mathias followed his goddess's signs, leading
them to a bluff overlooking the bandit camp,
a dozen bandits strong. Mathias turned to
Patrelius, “The goddess says you walk alone
here.” Patrelius grinned, pulling his gladius.

Tactics: Faith, Stone, and Steel
Being the only one in the party effective
at range, Herb finds a good vantage from
which he can cover the approach of his allies.
Amongst a hail of stones, Patrelius escorts
Mathias to the center of the action where his
power words will have the greatest effect.
To ensure Mathias can pray unhindered,
Herb then slips into the fray directly, ready
to sucker punch anything that gets too close.
They work to draw attention, bringing their
foes within Mathias's range. As he finishes
his prayers, the holy power of his goddess is
unleashed on their enemies and Herb and
Patrelius enjoy cleaning up what's left.
