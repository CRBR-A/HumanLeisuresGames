Brains and Brawn

Members:
- Lem Razar, The Academic
- Miraya Dunn, The Illusionist
- Wriba Sambo, The Amazon

Origin story: A Fateful Rescue
Lem and Miraya met in the course of their
studies and became fast friends over their
enthusiasm for understanding and exploiting
the psyche of monsters, as well as exploring
dangerous depths. During their very first
adventure together, they rescued Wriba from
an orc warband's fruitless torture. She quickly
became the brawn to their brains.

Recent adventure: Mapping the Caverns
Tasked with mapping out an entire cave
system, they instead opted to cleave off a
kobold chieftain's head and force his tribe to
map it for them. Now that's using your head.

Tactics: Smash in Case of Emergency
Too often for Wriba's liking, Brains and Brawn
can get by on brains alone. Lem and Miraya
work together well, with Lem pointing out a
monster's weaknesses and Miraya using her
illusions to exploit it. This strong teamwork
often leaves Wriba wondering what to do.
At the slightest hint of things going awry,
or when boredom happens to kick in, Wriba
jumps in and takes the lead. Kicking and
cleaving her way to the sanctum, the others
follow her in. They try to keep as much
danger off Wriba as possible, and take
care of anything that makes it through her
whirlwind of destruction.
