The Wildling

The wildling has survived the last twenty years by
himself deep in the wilderness. More feral than most
monsters, he can run through dense forest like it's
a paved road and sniff out anything that doesn't
belong in his domain. Should he happen to find a
dungeon, he jumps in head first for a little fun.

The wildling is GENEROUS, but DUMB.
He seeks THRILLS on adventures.

POSSIBLE LOOT:
Depending on your luck, you might find him to be
carrying dire wolf fur, carved antler daggers, a gnoll
tooth necklace, a throwing hatchet, otter skin boots,
twelve-leaf ointment, moonshine, numbing bark, or
ironwood vines.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about an
overgrown crater, the fruit of a talking tree, or an
abandoned druid grove.
