The Ranger

The ranger grew up in a nomadic forest tribe that
bred and trained ferocious bears to be dangerous
mounts. His people often encountered monsters,
who also sought the cover of the dense forest, and
became quite adept at combating evil. If his bolts
don't end things, the bear's maulings surely will.

The ranger is CLEVER, but IMPATIENT.
He seeks EXPLORATION on adventures.

LAST WORDS:
When broken, he might spill his guts about where
the guardian bear spirit roams, a magic tree, or a
stream ripe with gold.
