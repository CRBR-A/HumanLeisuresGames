""Wicked Ones is a Forged in the Dark (FitD) game, based on the system 
mechanics and unique playstyle developed by John Harper for the game Blades in 
the Dark. FitD games focus on intense periods of zoomed-in action where events 
unfold in interesting ways without the need for excessive planning by the 
players. It has a flexible resolution system that lets you get creative with 
character actions. It’s all about cutting to the action and getting to the 
good parts. It makes for wonderfully chaotic stories where no matter what you 
do, things are bound to go wrong - because that’s what happens to scoundrels 
in Blades or monsters building a dungeon.""

It concern the system mechanics : 
- character's actions, abilities, attributes, goal
- clocks, game phases
- stress, position & effect, consequences
