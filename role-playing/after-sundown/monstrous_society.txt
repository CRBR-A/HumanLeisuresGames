# Monstrous Society

## Organization of the Damned

*"There's evil stuff going on in here. And I want in."*

Supernatural creatures are in the big scheme of things rather rare. An
individual Werewolf may go their entire life without ever encountering
another supernatural creature (beyond of course the Werewolf that mauled
them into their current state in the first place). So it's not
surprising that when they *do* find each other they tend to make
exclusive clubs. These social organizations are in many ways templated
on the human social organizations that the creatures that created them
lived in when they mingled in human society. And with the sheer *age*
that some creatures possess, it is perhaps unsurprising that many of
these organizations are in fact crazy old-fashioned.
