# Skills

*No one may ever know if what you did was good or bad, but you did it
well.*

A key portion of the die roll for any test is the *skill*. It represents
*specific* training that helps a character perform a task. And because
of that, it can lead to a far amount of confusion among some people,
because linguistically we refer both to people who are very good at
something and also people who are good at a wide variety of things as
being "skilled". In After Sundown, skills are basically confined to the
former interpretation. Jacks of All Trades are represented game
mechanically by people who have relatively high *attributes* and low
skills. People with high skills are specialists by definition.
