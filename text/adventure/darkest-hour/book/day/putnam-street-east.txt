  "It's happening again," he says. "When I was young, I had a neighbor from a
  foreign country. He told a fantastic story about a witch who tried to protect
  herself from vampires, by making a brew of all the things they hate. It
  worked, but not how she planned. She was bitten, but her spell didn't work
  till after she became a vampire. Now things like garlic don't harm her. It
  was only a story, but then people started disappearing - even the old man. I
  think his story was true. Anyway, I just took apart my tent to get a wooden
  stake. Not sure if it'll stop her, but you're welcome to have one too."
