  !ITEM_RING:
    "Hello," the librarian smiles. "Oh yeah, we have lots of books about vampires.
    There's Dracula, of course, and... oh, a real one? No, sorry, I don't believe
    in vampires. Hey, you haven't seen a diamond ring around here, have you? I
    lost it sometime this morning and can't find it anywhere! It's my wedding ring
    and... no?  Okay. Thanks anyway."
  ITEM_RING && !ITEM_BIBLE: 
    "You found it!" the librarian shouts, making everyone stare. "Thank you! Oh,
    by the way..." and here her voice softens, "please come with me." You follow
    her into her office, and she closes the door. "The vampire is real! I saw
    her!" she says. "Last night she attacked me when I was out looking for my
    ring. But then, my Bible fell out of my pocket, and she just... flew away!
    I think the Bible scares her like she scares us. Here, you can have my spare."
