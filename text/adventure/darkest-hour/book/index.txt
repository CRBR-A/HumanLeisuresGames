  Halloween is almost here, but something is happening that's much scarier than
  the annual haunted house at the fire hall. There are rumors of a vampire - a 
  real one - attacking people at night. Of course most people think it's just 
  silly; who wouldn't? But people are going missing, and others swear they've 
  seen it. It's up to you to track down this vampire, stop it if possible. The 
  question is, will you even survive the night?
note: 
  the vampire rest the day, and move at night
