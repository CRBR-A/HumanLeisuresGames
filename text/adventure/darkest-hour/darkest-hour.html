    look:
      Halloween is almost here, but something is happening that's much scarier than
      the annual haunted house at the fire hall. There are rumors of a vampire - a 
      real one - attacking people at night. Of course most people think it's just 
      silly; who wouldn't? But people are going missing, and others swear they've 
      seen it. It's up to you to track down this vampire, stop it if possible. The 
      question is, will you even survive the night?
    note: 
      the vampire rest the day, and move at night
      turns: 6 turn before night

      worked, but not how she planned. She was bitten, but her spell didn't work
      till after she became a vampire. Now things like garlic don't harm her. It
      was only a story, but then people started disappearing - even the old man. I

    location: MATTHEWS MANSION
    time: night
    look:
      !ITEM_BIBLE:
        You're standing in front of a huge mansion. The gates creak open as you walk
        towards them. You carefully step through, trying not to make a sound. But as
        soon as you're inside, the gates slam behind you! You run back to find them
        locked! You turn around as the front door of the mansion swings open. A lady
        steps out and the door closes behind her. With a flick of her wrist, you are
        flung down to the foot of the staircase!
        "Welcome to my new home," she says, "I hope you like it here, because it's the
        last place you will ever see!"
        GAME OVER
      ITEM_BIBLE:
        You duck behind a car as the vampire flies by. Did she see you? You wait a
        few minutes, then step out. The gate is wide open, so you sneak in. She left
        the front door open, so you step inside. The room is pitch dark, but you turn
        on a light switch. What the...?! Is that a coffin?! Thinking about all you
        have heard, you know what you have to do. You take a deep breath, look around
        one last time, and lift the top of the coffin. It's empty, so you throw the
        Bible inside it and close the lid.
        "What are you doing?! Get away from there!" The vampire shouts, charging into
        the room. She throws you against a wall, opens the coffin, and falls over
        backwards! Gasping for air, she pulls herself off the ground. "You...! Take
        it out! Take it out NOW!"
        You try to run, but find you can't move. "Take it out or I'll... what... is...
        happening...?!" Suddenly you find you can move again - she can't! Through the
        window in the front door, you can see a single ray of light peeking out from
        behind her front gate, touching her forehead. You run to the windows, ripping
        off the curtains.
        "No, stop!" she yells, "NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!"
        As the sun rises, the room is flooded with brilliant orange light. The vampire
        screams, then dissolves into a heap of ash. Catching your breath, you realize
        your adventure has finally ended. This evil creature's days of hunting the
        innocent are over. Not exactly a happy ending, but you survived...
        "You did it!" You hear someone say, "you destroyed her! We're free!"
        You watch as two people step out from another room. "She was keeping us here,
        keeping us alive just so she could keep drinking..." said a man, holding back
        tears. "Thank you! God bless you! I've got to get back to my wife!"
        "And my son!" said a lady, "he probably thinks I left him! Oh thank you so
        much! Come on, let's all go home!"

      "Oh, she's real," she says, downing another drink. "I've seen her. One
      night, a bunch of bats flew out of our fireplace, and I swear... they turned
      into the vampire! She snatched him away in a second, then came for me. I ran
      to the kitchen and got garlic, but she kept coming, till she bumped into his
      old Bible. Then she freaked and vanished. I don't get it, but now I'm walking
      around with a Bible all the time. If I were you, I'd get one. I just wish..."

    <div id="night_attack" class="attack night">
    location: Vampire attack during traveling
    time: night
    NO_ITEM: 
      Smoke swirls around you, blotting out the starry sky. You hear her laugh, and
      see her bright yellow eyes stare at you. Instantly she's at your throat, and
      everything goes black...
      GAME OVER
    ITEM_STAKE:
      The vampire grabs you by the throat! You use your wooden stake to try to fend
      her off! It snaps like a twig against her chest, and she laughs.
      "Should have listened to the old man," she says, finishing you off...
      GAME OVER
    ITEM_BULLETS:
      Someone knocks you to the ground! You jump to your feet and face her. A tall,
      dark-haired woman in a black robe hovers off the ground in front of you. She
      smiles, and you see this lady has razor-sharp fangs! You draw your gun and
      fire! A direct hit!
      "Seriously?" she laughs, "do I look like a werewolf?" You now realize your
      mistake, but it's too late...
      GAME OVER
    ITEM_GARLIC:
      You turn the corner and find yourself standing face-to-face with the vampire!
      She smiles, showing her long white fangs. You bite the garlic, chew, and spit
      it in her face!
      "That's disgusting," she says, wiping the junk off her cheek. "And I'm done
      playing!" As she says this, her feet lift off the ground. You run as fast as
      you can, but it's not fast enough! She grabs you, and everything goes black...
      GAME OVER
    ITEM_CRUCIFIX:
      You walk down the quiet road, turning around every few minutes. The sounds
      here make you feel like someone's there watching you. You grab the crucifix,
      just in case. Whoa! Oh, just a cat. It's not her. You laugh at how paranoid
      this vampire hunt has made you. Is it even real?
      Then you get your answer! Bats surround you! You swat them away, and someone
      grabs you from behind! You try to break free, holding up the crucifix like in
      the movies. "That's just a symbol," she smiles, her hot breath on your neck,
      "And He isn't there anymore..."
      GAME OVER
    ITEM_BIBLE:
      Suddenly, the vampire strikes! You fall on your back! In a moment she's
      standing over you, grabbing your neck! You pull the Bible out of your pocket,
      and she jumps back!
      "The Living Word!" she screams, vanishing in a puff of smoke. You get up and
      look around. She's gone.
