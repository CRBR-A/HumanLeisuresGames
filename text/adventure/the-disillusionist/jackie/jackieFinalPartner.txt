title: Take Her Offer
'''
You accept the trinket. It's a small figurine — sealbone, if you're any judge — carved in the
shape of some north sea deity you don't recognize. Jackie's partner seems pleased at your
acceptance, but she still shoots you a warning glare before departing the library. It's the
last you ever see of her.

Jackie is crestfallen but unsurprised to hear of your failure. He seems to sink further into
his chair as you close the door behind you on the way out. He wouldn't hear of your advice
to try and adapt to this new world. "Fat lot of good it did you in finding my partner, Dis."
