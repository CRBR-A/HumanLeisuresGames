title: A fate resolved

'''
Two gunshots ring across the parlor. One from Roxy's gunâ€¦ and one from yours. You couldn't say
which one actually felled Mr. Brown, but he now sports two bleeding wounds that are quickly
marring his suit with blood.

You hear the sound of footsteps rushing outside at the same time as you feel the warpweave
rush back into the room. Your wizard is so shocked that he's forgotten to do his job. This
proves to be in your favor, however.

In a flash of blue light, you suddenly find yourself
on the roof of Roxy's headquarters. She's teleported both of you away from the crime scene.
There, she fixes you with a stern glare.

"What the hell was that, Dis? What did you think you were doing?"
