id: solve1
title: A cold day

Your hand hesitates, just a moment, before knocking on Mrs. Brown's door. You have the answers
she wanted, but is this really going
to make her life any better? What does justice even mean in a situation like this one? To
walk away and leave the case unsolved might be the kindest thing for all involved and the
closest thing to justice that could come from this.

But you don't get paid to make those kinds of calls. You get paid to deliver information. And
that's what you're here to do, at long last, for Mrs. Brown. This isn't the first time the
news hasn't been what your client was hoping for. It may be a situation that's unique in your
experience — and likely anyone else's — but it's no different in that way than breaking the
news to someone that their spouse is a cheating bastard or that their loved one's current
address is in the city morgue.

You turn and glance at your companions. One is a wizard friend from the old days. You'll owe
him a favor for this, and you're not looking forward to repaying it. The other
is an ex-boxer that owes _you_ a favor for helping him clear his name and reputation a few
years ago. Both are going to be essential to surviving today.
