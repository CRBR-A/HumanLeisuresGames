Roxy laughs. "You still fancy yourself as some kind of hero?" Her gun is
suddenly in her hand. "Listen, Dis. That vengeance was mine and mine alone. You don't get to
take that from me." There is a tense moment before she continues. "So unless you want to end
up very dead, you are going to agree that I shot him first and thenâ€”" She shoves the gun
towards you. "_Never_ cross me again. But your did it for Abigail, so this one time, I'll let
you leave alive."

It leaves a bitter taste in your mouth, but you consent to her version of events.
As you're opening the door to the stairs, you hear Roxy say
"You know, if you want a place to hide out now that you're a wanted criminal, my
organization could use a person like you, Dis."

It's an offer you may have to consider.
