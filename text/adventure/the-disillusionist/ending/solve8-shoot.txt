title: A fate resolved


Roxy coughs in surprise and falls to the rooftop.

At last, every criminal in this case has
been dealt with. Mrs. Brown's murderer is dead, and so is the woman who took Mr. Brown's
identity away from him.

Solemnly, you walk over to Roxy's body and take her gun. It's going to take every bullet
you have and a fair bit of luck to get out of here alive.

But at least you can be sure that
justice, as far as you're concerned, was served today.
