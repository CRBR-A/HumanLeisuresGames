title: A man revealed

Your wizard friend begins to weave his work. There is a feeling like an oncoming storm, of the
pressure in the room dropping. He's lowered the ambient warpweave levels in order to isolate
the illusions at play.

And then, all at once, the illusion breaks. Mrs. Brown is like so much water, dumped out of
a dirty bucket. She washes away onto the floor, leaving behind a confused, weak-kneed,
mustachioed man in a fawn suit.

"What? What the devil? Where amâ€”"

You don't give him time to finish.
