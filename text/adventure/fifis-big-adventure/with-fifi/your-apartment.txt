  Your Apartment building stands tall with a familiar red brick facade. The
  entrance has a small canopy, and potted plants flank either side of the
  door.

  north: >
    The forest to the north looks serene, but there's no path leading into it
    from here.
  south: Pizzeria
  southwest: Vet
  west: Fifi's Person's Apartment
  inside: >
    Your apartment feels warm and welcoming. The living room is adorned with
    personal mementos and photos. A comfortable couch faces a TV, and nearby,
    there's a small dining area. The scent of the last meal cooked lingers
    pleasantly in the air. It's a haven of personal comfort and memories.
    if fifi: >
      Fifi, recognizing the place from previous visits, immediately finds a
      comfy spot on the couch. She gives a contented sigh, clearly at ease in
      the familiar environment.
    if !fifi:
      The apartment feels a bit empty without Fifi's lively presence. You spot
      a chew toy she left behind during her last visit and hope to reunite her
      with it soon.
