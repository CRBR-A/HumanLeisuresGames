Text adventure game for CS 160

Authors: Alexander DuPree, Jacob Bickle


It is recommended you play our game in fullscreen!

There are a few commands you should get familiar with before you play our game.
Here are some global commands:

goto <location>: Moves you to the next room.

examine <item or room>: Inspect an item.

use <item>: Use an item.

pickup <item>: Pick up an item in the current room.

inventory: Display all items in your inventory.

equip <weapon>: Equip a weapon.

status: Provides general information about you and the current room.

quit: Quit the game.

While you are playing, the game will ask for an action with the ">  " icon. All you
have to do is type in one of the keywords and a noun if needed. For example:

goto waterfall

or

examine room

or

inventory

Whenever you enter a room, the game will print out a room description for you. In
the room description locations you can travel to will be in all CAPS i.e.("You see
a TUNNEL and a CAVE"). Items that can be manipulated or examined in the rooms will
have the first letter capitalized i.e. ("You see a Bandage, and a Knife"). If you
want to examine your current room further just type 'examine room'.

At any point in the game you can type inventory to see what your player currently holds. You can also type status to figure out what items are in the room as well as
what rooms you can travel too.

Our game loads all characters, enemies, rooms, and objects from the game_start.txt
file. If you ever want to change your adventure all you have to do is change the
game_start.txt.

We hope you enjoy our game!
