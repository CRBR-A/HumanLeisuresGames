  You follow the sounds to a waterfall. The water looks odd, and illuminates 
  the cave. What's that at the base of it? You walk through the water to 
  reveal a securely locked door with a keypad! It has four digit slots, 
  waiting for input. What could possibly be on the other side?
  
  The waterfall is pretty, but its slight glow is off-putting. You step up to
  the keypad.
