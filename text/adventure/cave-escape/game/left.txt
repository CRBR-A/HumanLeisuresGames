  Somehow, your legs are functional and manage to carry you from room to room.
  This is fortunate, because a Torch on the wall reveals another fork in the 
  path, with more rooms. You may continue to follow the sound of water to the 
  WATERFALL, walk into the dark, scary TUNNEL, head back to the HOLE you fell 
  into, or perhaps stay and Examine the place!
  
  The TORCH on the wall flickers. The cave is rather small, with the craggy 
  rock walls arching upwards. The dark TUNNEL holds a looming fear over you. 
  The sound of the WATERFALL keeps your peace, however. You may also head back
  to the HOLE.
  Looking closer at your surroundings you see a Body next to the water. The 
  body is old, and rotting. There are no signs of a struggle. The only clue 
  to his death is the pile of vomit near the water. You can drink of the odd
  looking water. You are thirsty after all. Also, picking up that Torch may
  be a good idea. 
  You can go to WATERFALL, the TUNNEL, or the HOLE.

    You drink the water, and immediately feel nauseous.
