  It's too dark. You let your eyes adjust. It's still too dark. You hear the 
  snarl of an angry canine. You can't go on further, unless you use a Torch. 
  Where had you seen one before?
  
  Your torch illuminates a fearsome wolf gnawing on fresh meat.

  The walls begin to narrow, signaling the end of the tunnel is near. Your 
  shivering fear of the wolf remains after you vanquished it. This tunnel is 
  only a continuation from the LEFT, and leads onwards into the EXTENSION.

    The wolf is taken aback by your friendly gesture.
    You scratch him behind the ears, he loves it and decides to be your friend.
    The wolf leaves you in peace.
