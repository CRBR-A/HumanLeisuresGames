  Clicks and clacks of mechanisms hidden within the walls begin, and the door
  slowly opens up revealing a dimly lit, but otherwise well decorated room. 
  The walls are made of metal, and this place seemingly looks like a lobby of
  some sort. Furniture is knocked over, papers everywhere, the room is a mess,
  but you can tell this once held a safe work environment for...someone. 
  A room with a CAGE startles you as a wolf attempts to jump at you in rage. 
  You figure it may be best to not mess with it, however you notice an unused
  speargun lying within the cage. You try the doors, and they're all locked
  except for two. The only other available room is one labeled LAB. If you'd 
  like, you can head back to the WATERFALL.
