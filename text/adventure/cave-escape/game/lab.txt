  You slide the lab door open, revealing a large, starving bear helping itself
  to a poor sucker in a lab coat. Uh oh, this is not going to end well!
  
  There is broken glass everywhere, and the only way to see the room is a 
  pulsing red light. With the bear defeated you notice a priceless aztec 
  STATUE sitting firmly upon an altar at the rear of the room. You can go to
  the STATUE, or it might be a good idea to just use that cellphone and get 
  the hell out of here.

  statue
take:

  bear: 
    The bear is taken aback by your friendly gesture.
    You scratch him behind the ears, he loves it and decides to be your friend.
    The bear leaves you in peace.
